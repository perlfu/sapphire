\section{A Simple MMTk Tutorial Version 0.1}

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a basic introduction to
MMTk. It is a walk-through of the process of building an
incrementally more advanced collector.

The tutorial is nothing more than a step by step guide, and does not
provide detailed documentation. We feel that taking this slice
through MMTk is an efficient way help people rapidly become
productive in the MMTk environment.

It is estimated that blindly following the steps of the tutorial
should take around half a day. The amount of time to really
understand MMTk is highly variable, depending both on knowledge of
memory management techniques and programming experience.

\subsection{Preliminaries}

Getting MMTk and Jikes RVM and Eclipse working.

\begin{itemize}
\item Download Jikes RVM version 2.3.7 or later (see the Jikes RVM
home page and userguide).

\item Make sure you can build and run a BaseBaseNoGC configuration
(see the Jikes RVM userguide).

\item Open MMTk in Eclipse (see Eclipse documentation for further
information)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start Eclipse. If prompted provide a workspace directory
    somewhere in your home directory (not RVM\_ROOT or its
    descendants).
    \item Select File \menu{} Import...
    \item Choose `Existing Project into Workspace'
    \item Browse to the directory where your MMTk tree
    sits (\file{\env{RVM\_ROOT}/MMTk}).
    \item Select Finish.
    \item Switch to the Java perspective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adding the Tutorial collector}

The goal is to create a tutorial collector. In order to achieve
this, we will use the NoGC collector in MMTk as a template.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Add a new Jikes RVM configuration.} \\
    For the Tutorial GC, we use the NoGC configuration as a
    template.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Copy the GC configuration file \\
    \cmd{cd \$RVM\_ROOT/config/build/gc} \\
    \cmd{cp NoGC Tutorial}

    \item Edit \file{Tutorial}, changing the line: \\
    \shline{export RVM\_WITH\_JMTK\_PLAN="org.mmtk.plan.nogc.NoGC"} \\ to \\
    \shline{export RVM\_WITH\_JMTK\_PLAN="org.mmtk.plan.tutorial.Tutorial"}

    \item Copy the build configuration file. \\
    \cmd{cd \$RVM\_ROOT/config/build} \\
    \cmd{cp BaseBaseNoGC BaseBaseTutorial}

    \item Edit \file{BaseBaseTutorial}, changing the line: \\
    \shline{. \$1/gc/NoGC} \\ to \\
    \shline{. \$1/gc/Tutorial}

    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Create the Tutorial package within MMTk (using Eclipse) by cloning NoGC.}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Copy the \code{org.mmtk.plan.nogc} package, renaming it to
    \code{org.mmtk.plan.tutorial}. (Highlight the \code{org.mmtk.plan.nogc} package, and
    select Edit\menu{}Copy followed by Edit\menu{}Paste.)

    \item Rename each of the classes within the new tutorial package,
    replacing the substring `NoGC' with `Tutorial'. (Use Eclipse's
    rename facility (File\menu{}Rename...) with its default options (update
    references) to do this automatically, one class at a time).  If you
    look inside any of the renamed classes you should find that they are
    properly renamed, with new class names, constructors etc. replacing
    `NoGC' with `Tutorial' throughout.
    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Make sure you can build and run the new
    BaseBaseTutorial configuration.} \\
    It should behave \emph{exactly} the same as the BaseBaseNoGC
    configuration (it should fail with an out of memory error as
    soon as it has exhausted the maximum heap size specified on
    the command line with -Xms). To run the SPECjvm98 jess benchmark,
    for example:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \cmd{cd} to a directory containing SPECjvm98
        \item \cmd{rvm -Xmx25M -Xms25M -X:gc:verbose=3 -X:gc:ignoreSystemGC=true SpecApplication \_202\_jess}
    \end{enumerate}
    The above will set the minimum (\code{-Xms25M}) and maximum (\code{-Xmx25M}) heap size
    to 25MB in which to run the benchmark, and will produce verbose (\code{-X:gc:verbose=3}) GC
    messages. In order to run for longer, we tell MMTk to ignore calls to \code{System.gc()} (\code{-X:gc:ignoreSystemGC=true}).
    The rest of the command line arguments are specific to
    SPECjvm98. For a full list of command line arguments run
    \cmd{rvm -X:gc}, and for default values, run \cmd{rvm
    -X:gc:printOptions}.

\item \textbf{Change the Tutorial plan to use a MarkSweep garbage collector.}
    It currently uses a bump pointer allocator and does not perform
    collection.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a free list allocator instead of a bump-pointer
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In \code{TutorialConstraints}, update GC header requirements:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \code{gcHeaderBits()} should return
        \code{MarkSweepSpace.LOCAL\_GC\_BITS\_REQUIRED}
        \item \code{gcHeaderWords()} should return
        \code{MarkSweepSpace.GC\_HEADER\_WORDS\_REQUIRED}
        \item Add the appropriate import statement.
        \end{itemize}

        \item In \code{Tutorial}, replace the \code{ImmortalSpace} with a
        \code{MarkSweepSpace}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item change the appropriate import statement
            \item change the type of \code{defSpace} and change the constructor
            appropriately.
            \item rename \code{defSpace} to \code{msSpace} (right-click, Refactor\menu{}Rename...)
            \item rename \code{DEF} to \code{MARK\_SWEEP} (right-click, Refactor\menu{}Rename...)
            \item at this point \code{TutorialLocal} will be broken (for a moment...)
        \end{itemize}

        \item In \code{TutorialLocal}, replace the \code{ImmortalLocal} (a bump
        pointer) with a \code{MarkSweepLocal} (a free-list allocator):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item change the appropriate import statement
            \item change the type of \code{def} and change the constructor appropriately.
            \item rename \code{def} to \code{ms} (right-click, Refactor?Rename...)
            \item add an extra argument to \code{alloc()}: \code{ms.alloc(bytes, align, offset,
            false);} because the free list allocator needs to know whether the allocation
            is occuring during GC (since alloc is never called during GC, we just pass the
            value false).
        \end{itemize}

        \item Fix \code{postAlloc()} to initialize the mark-sweep header:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item add the following clause: \\
            \code{if (allocator == Tutorial.ALLOC\_DEFAULT) \\
            Tutorial.msSpace.initializeHeader(ref);}
        \end{itemize}


        \item With these changes, Tutorial should now work, just as it did before,
        only exercising a free list (mark-sweep) allocator rather than a bump pointer
        (immortal) allocator. Create a BaseBaseTutorial build, and test your system to
        ensure it performs just as it did before.  You may notice that its
        memory is exhausted slightly earlier because the free list allocator
        is slightly less efficient in space utilization than the bump
        pointer allocator.
    \end{enumerate}



    \item \textbf{Perform mark-and-sweep collection whenever the heap is exhausted}
    \begin{enumerate}

        \item In \code{Tutorial.poll()}, first insert a guard to
        ensure collections are not triggered at the wrong times:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \code{if (collectionsInitiated > 0 || !initialized || space ==
            metaDataSpace) \\ return false;}
        \end{itemize}

        \item Then in \code{Tutorial.poll()}, trigger a collection when the heap is exhausted:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Remove the \code{Assert} statement.
            \item Add the following: \\
                \code{if (getPagesReserved() > getTotalPages()) \{ \\
                   Collection.triggerCollection(Collection.RESOURCE\_GC\_TRIGGER);
                   \\
                   return true; \\ \} }
            \item Add the appropriate import statement.
        \end{itemize}

        \item In \code{Tutorial}, add global collection phases:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Make \code{Tutorial} extend \code{StopTheWorld} rather than \code{Plan}.
            \item Remove the \code{Assert} call in \code{Tutorial.collectionPhase()}
            \item Using the commented template in
            \code{Tutorial.collectionPhase()}, set the following
            within the clause for
            \code{phaseId == PREPARE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{super.collectionPhase(phaseId);}
                \item[] \code{trace.prepare();}
                \item[] \code{msSpace.prepare();}
                \item[] \code{return;}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Within the clause for \code{phaseId == RELEASE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{trace.release();}
                \item[] \code{msSpace.release();}
                \item[] \code{super.collectionPhase(phaseId);}
                \item[] \code{return;}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Ensure that the default fall through (to
            \code{StopTheWorld} is uncommented.
        \end{itemize}

        \item In \code{TutorialLocal}, add local collection phases:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Make \code{TutorialLocal} extend \code{StopTheWorldLocal} rather than \code{PlanLocal}.
            \item Remove the \code{collect()} method in
            \code{TutorialLocal}
            \item Remove the \code{Assert} call in
            \code{TutorialLocal.collectionPhase()}.
            \item Using the commented template in \code{TutorialLocal.collectionPhase()} (being careful to replace \code{NoGC} with \code{Tutorial} in
            , set the following within the clause for
            \code{phaseId == Tutorial.PREPARE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{super.collectionPhase(phaseId, participating, primary);}
                \item[] \code{trace.prepare();}
                \item[] \code{ms.prepare();}
                \item[] \code{return;}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Within the clause for \code{phaseId == Tutorial.BEGIN\_CLOSURE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{trace.startTrace());}
                \item[] \code{trace.prepare();}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Within the clause for \code{phaseId == Tutorial.COMPLETE\_CLOSURE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{trace.completeTrace());}
                \item[] \code{trace.prepare();}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Within the clause for \code{phaseId == Tutorial.RELEASE}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \code{trace.release();}
                \item[] \code{ms.release();}
                \item[] \code{super.collectionPhase(phaseId, participating, primary);}
                \item[] \code{return;}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Ensure that the default fall through (to
            \code{StopTheWorldLocal} is uncommented.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}

    \item With these changes, Tutorial should now work correctly as a
    mark-sweep collector, allocating with a free list allocator and
    collecting the heap each time it is exhausted. Create a
    BaseBaseTutorial build, and test your system to ensure it performs
    correctly.  You should find that it correctly performs
    collections (this will only be visible if you have set the
    \code{-X:gc:verbose} flag appropriately).

    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


%4. Extend the Tutorial plan to create a "copy-MS" collector, which
%allocates into a copying nursery and at collection time, copies
%nursery survivors     into a mark-sweep space.  This plan does not
%require a write barrier (it is not strictly generational, as it will
%collect the whole heap each time         the heap is full).  It
%could be extended with a write barrier, allowing the nursery to be
%collected in isolation. Such a collector would be a
%generational mark-sweep collector, similar to GenMS. Explanation of
%nursery, nursery survivors.
%
%Add a copying nursery In TutorialConstraints, override the
%movesObjects() method to return true, reflecting that we are now
%building a copying collector: public boolean movesObjects() { return
%true; } In Tutorial, add a nursery space Create a new space,
%nurserySpace, of type CopySpace, and make it and msSpace each share
%0.3 of the available heap (change from 0.6).  The new copy space
%will initially be 'from-space', so provide false as the final
%(additional) argument to the CopySpace constructor. In the
%constructor argument change the string value to something like
%"nurserySpace".
%
%add the appropriate import statement
%
%Add a new space descriptor, NURSERY initialized with
%nurserySpace.getDescriptor(); Add nurserySpace to the prepare and
%release phases of collectionPhase(), passing the flag true to the
%prepare phase, indicating that the nursery is treated as
%'from-space' during the collection. Fix accounting to account for
%this new space:  Add nurserySpace to the equation in getPagesUsed(),
%add a method to override getCopyReserve() which returns
%nurserySpace.reservedPages(), and add a method to override
%getPagesAvail(), returning ((getTotalPages() - getPagesUsed())>>1),
%which allows for a copy reserve on the assumption that future
%allocation will go to the nursery and in the worst case will need to
%be copied. In TutorialLocal, add a nursery allocator. Add an
%instance of CopyLocal calling it nursery... the constructor argument
%would be Tutorial.nurserySpace
%
%Change alloc() to allocate into nursery... return
%nursery.alloc(bytesm align, offset);
%
%Remove mark-sweep initialization in postAlloc(), undoing step 3.1.4
%above, since no special post allocation initialization is required.
%Override allocCopy() with a new method which allocates into ms when
%the allocator is ALLOC_DEFAULT, passing
%Tutorial.msSpace.inMSCollection() as the final argument to
%ms.alloc().  Calls to allocCopy() with other allocator values should
%fall through to super.allocCopy(). Override postCopy() with a new
%method which does the following (the following is currently
%necessary, but can be considered to be a design bug, which we hope
%to fix soon):
%     Tutorial.msSpace.writeMarkBit(ref);
%     MarkSweepLocal.liveObject(ref);
%Add nursery.reset() to the release phase of collectionPhase(). In
%TutuorialLocal.getSpaceFromAllocator() add the statment if (a ==
%nursery) return Tutorial.nurserySpace; In
%TutorialLocal.getAllocatorFromSpace() add the statement if(space ==
%Tutorial.nurserySpace) return nursery;
%
%In TutorialTraceLocal, add tracing mechanisms to accommodate the new
%nursery. Add a clause to isLive() which calls
%Tutorial.nurserySpace.isLive(object) if the object is in the nursery
%space. Add a clause to traceObject(), which calls
%Tutorial.nurserySpace.traceObject(this, object) if the object is in
%the nursery space. Create a method that overrides precopyObject(),
%which returns null for null objects, calls
%Tutorial.nurserySpace.traceObject(this, object) if the object is in
%the nursery space, and returns the object otherwise. (Note: The
%precopyObject() is declared final in class TraceLocal, so we need to
%remove the final keyword to enable overriding)
%
%Create a method that overrides willNotMove(), which returns
%!Space.isInSpace(Tutorial.NURSERY, object); Create a method which
%overrides getAllocator() which returns Tutorial.ALLOC_DEFAULT. With
%these changes, Tutorial should now work correctly as a copy-MS
%collector, allocating with a bump pointer, promoting into a
%mark-sweep space, and collecting the heap each time it is exhausted.
%Create a BaseBaseTutorial build, and test your system to ensure it
%performs correctly.  You should find that it correctly performs
%collections (this will only be visible if you have set the
%-X:gc:verbose flag appropriately).  By reading the verbose GC output
%you should see data being collected from and allocated to the
%nursery and mark sweep spaces.
