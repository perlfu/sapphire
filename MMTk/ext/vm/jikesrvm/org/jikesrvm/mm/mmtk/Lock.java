/**
 * Simple, fair locks with deadlock detection.
 *
 * The implementation mimics a deli-counter and consists of two values:
 * the ticket dispenser and the now-serving display, both initially zero.
 * Acquiring a lock involves grabbing a ticket number from the dispenser
 * using a fetchAndIncrement and waiting until the ticket number equals
 * the now-serving display.  On release, the now-serving display is
 * also fetchAndIncremented.
 *
 * This implementation relies on there being less than 1<<32 waiters.
