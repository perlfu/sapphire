/**
 * This file is a <b>stub</b> file representing all VM-specific
 * constants. This file will be shadowed by a <i>concrete</i> instance
 * of itself supplied by the client VM, populated with VM-specific
 * values.  <i>The specific values in this stub file are therefore
 * meaningless.</i><p>
 *
 * Note that these methods look as though they are constants.  This is
 * intentional.  They would be constants except that we want MMTk to
 * be Java->bytecode compiled separately, ahead of time, in a
 * VM-neutral way.  MMTk must be compiled against this stub, but if
 * these were actual constants rather than methods, then the Java
 * compiler would legally constant propagate and constant fold the
 * values in this file, thereby ignoring the real values held in the
 * concrete VM-specific file.  The constants are realized correctly at
 * class initialization time, so the performance overhead of this
 * approach is negligible (and has been measured to be insignificant).
