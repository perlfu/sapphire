/**
 * This class (and its sub-classes) implement <i>per-collector thread</i>
 * behavior.  We assume <i>N</i> collector threads and <i>M</i>
 * mutator threads, where <i>N</i> is often equal to the number of
 * available processors, P (for P-way parallelism at GC-time), and
 * <i>M</i> may simply be the number of mutator (application) threads.
 * Both <i>N</i> and <i>M</i> are determined by the VM, not MMTk.  In
 * the case where a VM uses posix threads (pthreads) for each mutator
 * ("1:1" threading), <i>M</i> will typically be equal to the number of
 * mutator threads.  When a uses "green threads" or a hybrid threading
 * scheme (such as Jikes RVM), <i>M</i> will typically be equal to the
 * level of <i>true</i> parallelism (ie the number of underlying
 * kernel threads).<p>
 * 
 * Collector operations are separated into <i>per-collector thread</i>
 * operations (the bulk of the GC), and <i>per-mutator thread</i> operations
 * (important in flushing and restoring per-mutator state such as allocator
 * state and write buffer/remset state).  <code>SimplePhase</code>
 * ensures that per-collector thread GC phases are performed by each
 * collector thread, and that the <i>M</i> per-mutator thread operations
 * are multiplexed across the <i>N</i> active collector threads
 * (@see SimplePhase#delegatePhase).<p>
 * 
 * MMTk assumes that the VM instantiates instances of CollectorContext
 * in thread local storage (TLS) for each thread participating in 
 * collection.  Accesses to this state are therefore assumed to be 
 * low-cost at GC time.<p> 
 * 
 * MMTk explicitly separates thread-local (this class) and global
 * operations (@see Plan), so that syncrhonization is localized
 * and explicit, and thus hopefully minimized (@see Plan). Gloabl (Plan) 
 * and per-thread (this class) state are also explicitly separated.
 * Operations in this class (and its children) are therefore strictly
 * local to each collector thread, and synchronized operations always
 * happen via access to explicitly global classes such as Plan and its
 * children.<p>
 * 
 * This class (and its children) therefore typically implement per-collector
 * thread structures such as collection work queues.
