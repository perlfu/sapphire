/**
 * This plan has been modified slightly to perform the processing necessary
 * for GC trace generation.  To maximize performance, it attempts to remain
 * as faithful as possible to semiSpace/Plan.java.
 *
 * The generated trace format is as follows:
 *    B 345678 12
 *      (Object 345678 was created in the boot image with a size of 12 bytes)
 *    U 59843 234 47298
 *      (Update object 59843 at the slot at offset 234 to refer to 47298)
 *    S 1233 12345
 *      (Update static slot 1233 to refer to 12345)
 *    T 4567 78924
 *      (The TIB of 4567 is set to refer to 78924)
 *    D 342789
 *      (Object 342789 became unreachable)
 *    A 6860 24 346648 3
 *      (Object 6860 was allocated, requiring 24 bytes, with fp 346648 on
 *        thread 3; this allocation has perfect knowledge)
 *    a 6884 24 346640 5
 *      (Object 6864 was allocated, requiring 24 bytes, with fp 346640 on
 *        thread 5; this allocation DOES NOT have perfect knowledge)
 *    I 6860 24 346648 3
 *      (Object 6860 was allocated into immortal space, requiring 24 bytes,
 *        with fp 346648 on thread 3; this allocation has perfect knowledge)
 *    i 6884 24 346640 5
 *      (Object 6864 was allocated into immortal space, requiring 24 bytes,
 *        with fp 346640 on thread 5; this allocation DOES NOT have perfect
 *        knowledge)
 *    48954->[345]LObject;:blah()V:23   Ljava/lang/Foo;
 *      (Citation for: a) where the was allocated, fp of 48954,
 *         at the method with ID 345 -- or void Object.blah() -- and bytecode
 *         with offset 23; b) the object allocated is of type java.lang.Foo)
 *    D 342789 361460
 *      (Object 342789 became unreachable after 361460 was allocated)
 *
 * This class implements a simple semi-space collector. See the Jones
 * & Lins GC book, section 2.2 for an overview of the basic
 * algorithm. This implementation also includes a large object space
 * (LOS), and an uncollected "immortal" space.<p>
 *
 * All plans make a clear distinction between <i>global</i> and
 * <i>thread-local</i> activities.  Global activities must be
 * synchronized, whereas no synchronization is required for
 * thread-local activities.  Instances of Plan map 1:1 to "kernel
 * threads" (aka CPUs or in Jikes RVM, VM_Processors).  Thus instance
 * methods allow fast, unsychronized access to Plan utilities such as
 * allocation and collection.  Each instance rests on static resources
 * (such as memory and virtual memory resources) which are "global"
 * and therefore "static" members of Plan.  This mapping of threads to
 * instances is crucial to understanding the correctness and
 * performance proprties of this plan.
