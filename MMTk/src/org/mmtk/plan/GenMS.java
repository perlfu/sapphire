/**
 * This class implements the functionality of a two-generation copying
 * collector where <b>the higher generation is a mark-sweep space</b>
 * (free list allocation, mark-sweep collection).  Nursery collections
 * occur when either the heap is full or the nursery is full.  The
 * nursery size is determined by an optional command line argument.
 * If undefined, the nursery size is "infinite", so nursery
 * collections only occur when the heap is full (this is known as a
 * flexible-sized nursery collector).  Thus both fixed and flexible
 * nursery sizes are supported.  Full heap collections occur when the
 * nursery size has dropped to a statically defined threshold,
 * <code>NURSERY_THRESHOLD</code><p>
 *
 * See the Jones & Lins GC book, chapter 7 for a detailed discussion
 * of generational collection and section 7.3 for an overview of the
 * flexible nursery behavior ("The Standard ML of New Jersey
 * collector"), or go to Appel's paper "Simple generational garbage
 * collection and fast allocation." SP&E 19(2):171--183, 1989.<p>
 *
 * All plans make a clear distinction between <i>global</i> and
 * <i>thread-local</i> activities.  Global activities must be
 * synchronized, whereas no synchronization is required for
 * thread-local activities.  Instances of Plan map 1:1 to "kernel
 * threads" (aka CPUs or in Jikes RVM, VM_Processors).  Thus instance
 * methods allow fast, unsychronized access to Plan utilities such as
 * allocation and collection.  Each instance rests on static resources
 * (such as memory and virtual memory resources) which are "global"
 * and therefore "static" members of Plan.  This mapping of threads to
 * instances is crucial to understanding the correctness and
 * performance proprties of this plan.
