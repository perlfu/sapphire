/**
 * This class (and its sub-classes) implement <i>per-mutator thread</i>
 * behavior.  We assume <i>N</i> collector threads and <i>M</i>
 * mutator threads, where <i>N</i> is often equal to the number of
 * available processors, P (for P-way parallelism at GC-time), and
 * <i>M</i> may simply be the number of mutator (application) threads.
 * Both <i>N</i> and <i>M</i> are determined by the VM, not MMTk.  In
 * the case where a VM uses posix threads (pthreads) for each mutator
 * ("1:1" threading), <i>M</i> will typically be equal to the number of
 * mutator threads.  When a uses "green threads" or a hybrid threading
 * scheme (such as Jikes RVM), <i>M</i> will typically be equal to the
 * level of <i>true</i> parallelism (ie the number of underlying
 * kernel threads).<p>
 *
 * MMTk assumes that the VM instantiates instances of MutatorContext
 * in thread local storage (TLS) for each thread participating in
 * collection.  Accesses to this state are therefore assumed to be
 * low-cost during mutator time.<p>
 *
 * This class (and its children) is therefore used for unsynchronized
 * per-mutator operations such as <i>allocation</i> and <i>write barriers</i>.
 * The semantics and necessary state for these operations are therefore
 * specified in the GC-specific subclasses of this class.
 *
 * MMTk explicitly separates thread-local (this class) and global
 * operations (@see Plan), so that syncrhonization is localized
 * and explicit, and thus hopefully minimized (@see Plan). Gloabl (Plan)
 * and per-thread (this class) state are also explicitly separated.
 * Operations in this class (and its children) are therefore strictly
 * local to each mutator thread, and synchronized operations always
 * happen via access to explicitly global classes such as Plan and its
 * children.  Therefore only <i>"fast path"</i> (unsynchronized)
 * allocation and barrier semantics are defined in MutatorContext and
 * its subclasses.  These call out to <i>"slow path"</i> (synchronize(d)
 * methods which have global state and are globally synchronized.  For
 * example, an allocation fast path may bump a pointer without any
 * syncrhonization (the "fast path") until a limit is reached, at which
 * point the "slow path" is called, and more memory is aquired from a
 * global resource.<p>
 *
 * As the super-class of all per-mutator contexts, this class implements
 * basic per-mutator behavior common to all MMTk collectors, including
 * support for immortal and large object space allocation, as well as
 * empty stubs for write barriers (to be overridden by sub-classes as
 * needed).
