/**
 * This class implements a simple semi-space collector. See the Jones
 * & Lins GC book, section 2.2 for an overview of the basic
 * algorithm. This implementation also includes a large object space
 * (LOS), and an uncollected "immortal" space.<p>
 *
 * All plans make a clear distinction between <i>global</i> and
 * <i>thread-local</i> activities.  Global activities must be
 * synchronized, whereas no synchronization is required for
 * thread-local activities.  Instances of Plan map 1:1 to "kernel
 * threads" (aka CPUs or in Jikes RVM, VM_Processors).  Thus instance
 * methods allow fast, unsychronized access to Plan utilities such as
 * allocation and collection.  Each instance rests on static resources
 * (such as memory and virtual memory resources) which are "global"
 * and therefore "static" members of Plan.  This mapping of threads to
 * instances is crucial to understanding the correctness and
 * performance proprties of this plan.
