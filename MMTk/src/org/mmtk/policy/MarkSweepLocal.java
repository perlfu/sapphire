/**
 * This class implements unsynchronized (local) elements of a
 * mark-sweep collector.  Allocation is via the segregated free list
 * (@see SegregatedFreeList).  Marking is done using both a bit in
 * each header's object word, and a mark bitmap.  Sweeping is
 * performed lazily.<p>
 *
 * A free list block is a contiguous region of memory containing cells
 * of a single size class, and is a construct of the
 * SegregatedFreeList.  This class extends the block to include a mark
 * bitmap.  During the mark phase, if an object is encountered with
 * the mark bit in its header unset, it is set and the mark bit in the
 * block header corresponding to that object is set.  The rationale
 * behind this approach is that testing (and setting) the mark bit in
 * the object header is cheap, while using a bitmap makes sweeping
 * more efficient.  This approach maximizes the speed of the common
 * case when marking, while also allowing for fast sweeping, with
 * minimal space overhead (2 bits per object).
