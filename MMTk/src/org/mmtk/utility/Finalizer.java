/**
 * This class manages finalization.  When an object is created if its
 * class has a finalize() method, addElement below is called, and a
 * FinalizerListElement (see FinalizerListElement) is created for it.
 * While the object is old, the integer field of the list element
 * holds its value (this does not keep the object live during gc.  At
 * the end of gc, the list of FinalizerListElements is scanned for
 * objects which have become garbage.  Those which have are made live
 * again are moved to the live object list for finalization.
 * 
 * Elsewhere, there is a distinguished Finalizer thread which 
 * enqueues itself on the VM_Scheduler finalizerQueue.  At the end of gc, 
 * if needed and if the VM_Scheduler finalizerQueue is not empty, 
 * the finalizer thread is scheduled to be run when gc is completed.
