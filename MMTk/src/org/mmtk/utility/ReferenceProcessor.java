/**
 * This class manages soft, weak and phantom references.
 * The VM maintains a list of pending reference objects of the various
 * types.  This list is either outside the heap or uses addresses,
 * so that a reference will not stay alive during GC if it is not
 * used elsewhere in the mutator.  During GC, the various lists are
 * processed in the proper order to determine if any reference objects
 * are no longer active or whether referents that have died should be
 * kept alive.
