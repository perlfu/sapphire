/**
 * This abstract base class provides the basis for processor-local
 * allocation.  The key functionality provided is the retry mechanism
 * that is necessary to correctly handle the fact that a "slow-path"
 * allocation can cause a GC which violate the uninterruptability assumption.
 * This results in the thread being moved to a different processor so that
 * the allocator object it is using is not actually the one for the processor
 * it is running on.
 *
 * This class also includes functionality to assist allocators with
 * ensuring that requests are aligned according to requests.
 *
 * Failing to handle this properly will lead to very hard to trace bugs
 * where the allocation that caused a GC or allocations immediately following
 * GC are run incorrectly.
