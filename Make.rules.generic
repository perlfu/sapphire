# On AIX, where /bin/sh is a link to /bin/ksh, it is useful to have SHELL 
# set to /bin/bash. This is because, on AIX under ksh, "echo -n <message>" 
# emits the text "-n <message><NEWLINE>".   The Bash behavior, even when
# invoked as "sh", is to emit "<message>", without a trailing <NEWLINE>.
SHELL=/bin/bash
