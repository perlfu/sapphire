# This little program builds and installs GNU Classpath
# from a checked-out CVS repository.
#
# This is intended for use by a nightly regression script.
# You can also use it to build Classpath yourself.  When you've run it,
# then set CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION in RVM_{HOST,TARGET}_CONFIG to
# the second argument, which should now be the head of a 
# good GNU Classpath installation.

  then install it in <classpath-installation-dir>.  Use the proper
  configuration options for Jikes RVM.

  <classpath-config-args> are any extra configuration arguments you 
  want to use.
