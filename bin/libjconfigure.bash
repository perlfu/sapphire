# N.B.: This is an auxiliary set of library functions.  It is loaded
#       by "jconfigure" and by the "jbuild" and "jbuild."* scripts
#       that "jconfigure" generates.

#       We do not execute this script directly; the `#! /bin/bash'
#	is just there to give a hint to the Emacs text editor about which
#	variant of Shell-script mode it should use.

# The trace argument can be:
# -trace		 (gets most things but skips the thousands of
#			  lines of bootimagewriter output)
# -trace=ant		# Just ant is of interest
# -trace=jbuild		# high-level
# 
# This is then converted to appropriate values for TRACE_FLAG (q.v., below.)
# TRACE_FLAG: (empty)  # only if nothing was said
# TRACE_FLAG: ,no-all,
# TRACE_FLAG: ,-trace,
# We can be tracing any of the following
#	preprocessor,make,BootImageWriter,ant,jbuild
# As well as the groups:
#	most,all
# See the help message in "jbuild -help" for more info.

# "jbuild" and its children access TRACE_FLAG through the shell
# function tracing().

# Variables we'll refer to in jconfigure and in jbuild*:
#       
TRACE_FLAG=""			# Arguments to the -trace command-line
				# argument flag.

VFLAG=""			# Set to -v if we want to call "set -v" 
				#  in a shell script.

XFLAG=""			# Like VFLAG, but contains "-x"

CLEAN_FLAG=""

##
## The code in the rest of this file auto-detects the Bash version.
## This will affect anyone who's not running Bash 2.05a or
## newer (Bash 2.05a came out in 2001).

## I'm auto-detecting the Bash version because of an old problem where
## jconfigure would freeze up its Bash interpreter about one out of every
## five times when it was run under Bash version 2.05 (2.05a and 2.05b
## are OK.)
## 
## If you were running jconfigure under Bash version 2.03 or earlier, it
## had been aborting its execution with error messages.  The version
## detection code means that jconfigure instead exits with an
## understandable message.  (Note that Bash 2.03 came out in 1998).
## 
## If you run jconfigure under Bash 2.05, you now get a message warning
## you of the freeze-up problem.  If you have other Bash versions
## available (the AIX machines at Watson have three different Bash
## versions on them, in six different places in the file system), then
## it tells you which versions are available and suggests you modify
## your command search path to include one of them before the bad
## version you're using.
##
## The message tells you at the end how you can permanently suppress it
## if you don't care about it.
