# This is really an administrative script used by the core team to maintain
# the svn repository.  It's job is to normalize the svn properties on files
# based on their extensions.
#

# Source code files should have the following properties set:
#   svn:eol-style : native
#   svn:mime-type : text/plain
for extension in .java .c .h .C; do
    find . -name "*$extension" -print | xargs svn propset svn:eol-style native
    find . -name "*$extension" -print | xargs svn propset svn:mime-type text/plain
done
