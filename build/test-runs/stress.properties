# sub-tests that are excluded because they cannot pass yet

# These tests test atomicity of accesses for volatile longs and doubles.
# Changes to make them pass for the baseline compilers are work in progress
# (see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/RVM-1019). No effort has been
# started for the opt compilers yet.
