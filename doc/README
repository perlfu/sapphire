If you downloaded Jikes RVM as a .tar.gz file, then there's a copy of
the user's guide as a PostScript file in the root directory of the
distribution.

If you downloaded Jikes RVM from subversion, then that PostScript file won't
be present, but the user's guide is available on line at
<http://jikesrvm.sourceforge.net/userguide/HTML/userguide.html>.  
You don't need to build it yourself unless you want to help improve 
it or want a printable copy.

If you do want to build it yourself, you'll need the programs listed
in userguide/config.mk.
