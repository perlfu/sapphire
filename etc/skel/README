Skeleton.java

    Skeleton file to use to begin a new Java source file.  Contains
    an IBM copyright notice and Javadoc @author tag.

skeleton.C

    Like Skeleton.java but for C source code.

skeleton.sh

    Like Skeleton.java but for Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) source code.

GNUmakefile.skel

    A skeleton initial Makefile to use.  As the Java coding
    conventions suggest, we name our Makefiles "GNUmakefile".  Do the
    same with this one.
