./ Sample manual page for Jikes RVM.

./ Note: the version of "iconv" shipped with Red Hat Linux will
./ break if this manual page contains any characters from the
./ extended range (high-bit set) of the iso-8859-1 character set.
./ That's why this text is us-ascii instead.
./
./ Test your manual page with:
./    nroff -man skeleton.man | less
./

./ TODO: We need to use a macro-expansion process like that of 
./ GNU Configure so that we replace this with the proper version.
