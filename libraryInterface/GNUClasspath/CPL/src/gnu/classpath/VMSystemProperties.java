       I (Steve Augart) started a discussion about this on classpath@gnu.org
       on 23 March 2003.  Summary: we define user.timezone specifically in
       order to pass that information to GNU Classpath's implementation of
       java.util.TimeZone, which initializes
       later on in the boot process.  It does not seem to be required by the
       spec, and it's the empty string in Blackdown 1.4.2.

       We have to do this here, because otherwise it wouldn't be set until
       VM_CommandLineArgs.lateProcessCommandLineArguments().  That won't occur
       until the VM is fully booted; too late for java.util.TimeZone, which
       reads this value when it runs its initializer.
