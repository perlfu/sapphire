This is release 2.0.1 of the Jikes RVM. The main purposes
of this release are bug fixes, performance improvements for 
IA32, and improvements to the build process.  

Highlights include:

  - Linux/IA32 SMP (pthreads) support on Linux 2.4. 
    (Handling for threads that are stuck in native code
    is not fully supported on Linux at this time.)    
  - Improved IA32 floating-point instruction selection in 
    optimizing compiler.
  - IA32 optimizer generates conditional moves.
  - Improved load balancing.
  - New optimization to coalesce moves after leaving SSA 
    form.
  - New branch straightening optimization.
  - New expression folding optimization.
  - Improved iterative Heap Array SSA load elimination.
  - Improvements in BURS infrastructure that increase the
    effectiveness of opt compiler's instruction selection.	
  - IA32 baseline compiler support for write barriers.
  - Numerous fixes for PowerPC/Linux build.
  - New MethodCompilation callback.

the developerWorks bug tracking software tool.  
The following bugs in version 2.0.0 are fixed in 2.0.1:
