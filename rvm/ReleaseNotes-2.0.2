This is release 2.0.2 of the Jikes RVM. The main purposes
of this release are bug fixes, performance improvements for 
IA32, and minor improvements to the build process.  

Important:
  Starting in the 2.0.2 release, jconfigure now requires that 
  your RVM_TARGET_CONFIG file defines preprocessor directives 
  that specify the target architecture, operating system, and 
  whether or not your pthread library can support JikesRVM.  
  See the sample files in $RVM_ROOT/rvm/config. 
  Set RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR as follows:
    -- AIX/PowerPC:    0 (SMP is supported)
    -- Linux/PowerPC:  1 (SMP is not supported)
    -- Linux/IA32:     0 with a 2.2 kernel (SMP is not supported)
                       1 with a 2.4 kernel and glibc compiled to 
                         use the GS segment register to access
                         pthread-specific state. 
                
Highlights include:
  -- Improved IA32 performance (15% on specJVM98)
  -- Change in IA32 register convention to make EBP 
     a nonvolatile regster (RVM 2.0.2 does not use a 
     register to hold the framepointer on IA32).
  -- Simple static splitting transformation to create 
     intraprocedural hot traces based on static infrequent bit
  -- Redundant conditional branch elimination based on
     global value numbers and dominator information.
  -- Code-patch guard for guarded inlining (IA32 only).
