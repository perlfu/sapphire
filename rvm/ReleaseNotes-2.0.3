This is release 2.0.3 of the Jikes RVM. The main purpose
of this release is bug fixes.

Highlights include:
  -- Linux/IA32 jdp improvements including: many bug fixes for BaseOpt and 
     OptOpt bootimages; requiring hex values to
     be prefixed with '0x' or '0X'; clarifications in the help
     messages and userguide; stepline command fixed for BaseBase
     type builds; print variable-name command fixed for BaseBase
     when LoadLocalVariableTable is true. jdp still works
     better with BaseBase builds. 
  -- Regression tests now have test-specific timeout values
  -- Improvements in opt's code placement phase:
       (1) callee's with pragmaNoInline are marked as infrequent
       (2) uses dominator information to propagate infrequency
  -- Code cleanups in opt compiler's LIR: 
       (1) constant materialization delayed until translation to LIR
       (2) REF_ operators maintained through LIR.
  -- Backpatching-based dynamic linking eliminated from baseline PPC;
     table-based dynamic linking now used by all compilers on all platforms.
  -- Updated compiler DNA values for both AIX/PPC and Linix/IA32; these
     values are used by the adaptive system's cost/benefit model.

the developerWorks bug tracking software tool and CVS history.
