This is release 2.1.1 of the Jikes RVM. The main purpose of
this release is bug fixes.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are aware of a bug in the IBM DK for 
  Linux/IA32 v1.3.1 when building Jikes RVM.  Stick with 
  version v1.3.0 until this bug can be resolved.

Highlights of this release include:
 - Introduction of a new method-level runtime exception 
   pragma mechanism, contributed by Chapman Flack.  The 
   system now relies on this mechanism for method-level 
   pragmas for uninterruptibility and inlining directives.
 - Restructuring of baseline compiler to increase the 
   amount of platform-independent shared code.
 - Stricter enforcement of uninterruptibility rules.
 - Improvements to SSA optimization package to reduce 
   register pressure.  These changes make O2 profitable
   for use by the adaptive system on IA32.
 - The VM_CompilerInfo classes were folded into the 
   VM_CompiledMethod classes. 

NOTE: VM_Magic.pragmaInline and VM_Magic.pragmaNoInline 
are deprecated, and will not be supported in the 2.1.2 
release.  Migrate code to use the new runtime exception
pragma mechanism.
