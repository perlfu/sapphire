This is release 2.2.0 of the Jikes RVM. 
This release includes several major pieces of new 
functionality and a number of bug fixes.

Highlights of this release include:
  + Jikes RVM now mostly uses the GNU Classpath class 
    libraries. All library packages except java.lang, 
    java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.io, java.net, 
    and java.util are from Classpath. 
    We are optimistic that release 2.2.1 of Jikes RVM will
    be based entirely on the GNU Classpath libraries.  
  + The introduction of JMTk (Java Memory management Tool kit).
  + Numerous extensions and bug fixes to core VM functionality
    to support running a wider range of applications.
  + Support for gathering and exploiting dynamic 
    branch probabilities for conditional and multi-way branches.
  + Introduction of packages in the Jikes RVM source code.
  + A bytecode verifier contributed by L. Zhang (UCSB)
  + Support for Intel cycle counter contributed by 
    H. Lee and J. Palm (Colorado)
  + Support for PowerPC hardware performance counters on AIX 5.

Other notes:
  + As announced in the 2.1.1 release notes support for 
    VM_Magic.pragmaInline and VM_Magic.pragmaNoInline 
    has been removed.  Code must use the exception-based 
    pragma mechanism.
  + jdp is no longer supported. See the userguide for details.
  + We anticipate moving completely to JMTk and removing support
    for the watson collectors in a future release of Jikes RVM.
    This may happen as soon as the 2.2.1 release depending on JMTk 
    performance and stability.

A large number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.1.1 
are fixed in the 2.2.0 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.
