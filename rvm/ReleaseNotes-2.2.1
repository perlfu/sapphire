This is release 2.2.1 of the Jikes RVM. 
This release includes several major pieces of new 
functionality and a number of bug fixes.

Highlights of this release include:
  + Jikes RVM is now based entirely on the GNU Classpath libraries.  
    The prior hybrid library solution is still supported in
    this release, but will be removed in subsequent releases. 
    See the userguide for details on how to build with the hybrid libraries.
  + Jikes RVM can run a significant subset of the Eclipse IDE.
  + Separate name spaces for classloaders.
  + Implementation of JNI for Linux/PowerPC.
  + The addition of an on-stack replacement mechanism to
    enable the adaptive system transfer execution from long-running 
    baseline compiled frames and to recover from speculative 
    optimizations.  More details can be found in a CGO 2003 paper.
  + Extensions for PowerPC hardware performance counters on AIX 5.

Other notes:
  + Future release of Jikes RVM will not support using the OTI 
    class libaries.
  + We continue to anticipate moving completely to JMTk and removing 
    support for the watson collectors in a future release of Jikes RVM.
    This should happen in the 2.2.2 release depending on the 
    performance of the JMTk MarkSweep collector.

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.0
are fixed in the 2.2.1 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.
