This is release 2.2.2 of the Jikes RVM. 

Highlights of this release include:
  + Support for the hybrid library configuration has been
    removed and the library support code refactored to simplify
    the interface between the GNU Classpath libraries and Jikes RVM.
  + Defect 3383 has been resolved.  We now recomend using the 
    Blackdown 1.4.1 SDK to build Jikes RVM on Linux/IA32 and the 
    IBM 1.4 SDK to build Jikes RVM on AIX/PowerPC.
  + PowerPC hardware performance monitor tracing support for a multiprocessor on AIX 5.
  + Many code cleanups to prepare the code base for a port of Jikes RVM
    to 64 bit PowerPC.
  + VM_AddressArray. Changes to classloader to make VM_Address a primitive. 
    (Flesh this out & update the userguide accordingly).
  + Changed PowerPC version of VM_Assembler.java to uniformly use PowerPC 
    mnemonics for the instructions. 
  + The OutOfMemoryError exception is now thrown by the GC system.

Other notes:
  + Changes to configuration files:
	added MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_ADDRESS and dropped the "" from 
        BOOTIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS
  + sysCalls were moved from VM to VM_SysCall.  Naming conventions were 
    changed to make parameter/return types explicit in name.

Release planning:

Must do/fix items
-----------------
 -- Verify that Eclipse runs as expected on FastAdaptive and OptBase images
 -- Update VM documentation to reflect PPC64 changes
 -- update JMTk documentation to explictly list configurations
    believed to be stable vs. experimental (SemiSpace only stable
    config?).
    To be stable the config must pass all sanity tests with Full/Fast images.

Should do/fix
-------------
 -- cleanup command line processing and documentation for GC subsystem
 -- remaining Linux regression failures
