This is release 2.2.2 of the Jikes RVM. 

Highlights of this release include:
  + Support for the hybrid library configuration has been
    removed and the library support code refactored to simplify
    the interface between the GNU Classpath libraries and Jikes RVM.
  + Defect 3383 has been mostly resolved.  We now recomend using the 
    Blackdown 1.4.1 SDK to build Jikes RVM on Linux/IA32. 
  + Extensions for PowerPC hardware performance counters on AIX 5.
