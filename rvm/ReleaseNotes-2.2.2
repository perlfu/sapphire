This is release 2.2.2 of the Jikes RVM. 

Highlights of this release include:
  + Support for the hybrid library configuration has been
    removed and the library support code refactored to simplify
    the interface between the GNU Classpath libraries and Jikes RVM.
  + Defect 3383 has been resolved.  We now recomend using the 
    Blackdown 1.4.1 SDK to build Jikes RVM on Linux/IA32 and the 
    IBM 1.4 SDK to build Jikes RVM on AIX/PowerPC.
  + PowerPC hardware performance monitor tracing support for
    multiprocessors on AIX 5.
  + Work has stated on a port of Jikes RVM to 64 bit PowerPC. 
    This release includes a number of source code cleanups 
    (some complete, other still in progress) to make the system portable
    across 32 and 64 bit systems.  
  + A major rewrite of the PowerPC baseline compiler to enable it to
    generate code for both 32 and 64 bit PowerPC. As part of the redesign,
    the use of an explict SP register was eliminated and all accesses to 
    the expression stack are done by computing offsets from the FP at 
    compile time. 
    NOTE: The 64 bit PowerPC version of the baseline compiler 
    is very much a work in progress and is NOT expected to work in this 
    release.
  + Magic class (VM_AddressArray, etc) were added to enable arrays of 
    addresses to be safely created.  The classloader was enhanced to 
    treat VM_Address etc as primitive types.
  + Changed PowerPC version of VM_Assembler.java to uniformly use PowerPC 
    mnemonics for the instructions. 
  + The OutOfMemoryError exception is now thrown by the GC system.

Other notes:
  + Changes to configuration files:
	added MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_ADDRESS and dropped the "" from 
        BOOTIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS
  + sysCalls were moved from VM to VM_SysCall.  Naming conventions were 
    changed to make parameter/return types explicit in name.
  + a number of obsolete command line arguments were removed. 
    Do rvm -help and rvm -X to see the current set of supported options.

A number of other miscellaneous bugs in version 2.2.1
are fixed in the 2.2.2 release.  See the developerWorks bug 
tracking software tool and CVS history for details.
