These are release notes for the eventual release 2.3.1 of the Jikes RVM. 


Highlights of this release include:

Other notes:

We have fixed all C and C++ compiler warnings in the source code, under GCC
2.96, GCC 3.3, and GCC 3.3.1.  The only exception is warnings from GCC
2.96 of the form:
	ihnpdsm.C:4942: warning: `unused' attribute ignored
These are benign; ignore them.
