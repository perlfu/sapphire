These are release notes for the eventual release 2.3.1 of the Jikes RVM. 


Highlights of this release include:

Macintosh OSX support was generously contributed by Chris Hoffman of
the University of Massachusetts.  If you want to build Jikes RVM for
Mac OSX, you will need to patch your copy (version 0.06 or CVS head)
of GNU Classpath with the patch file located in
aux/gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch. 

Other notes:

We have fixed all C and C++ compiler warnings in the source code, under GCC
2.96, GCC 3.3, and GCC 3.3.1.  The only exception is warnings from GCC
2.96 of the form:
	ihnpdsm.C:4942: warning: `unused' attribute ignored
These are benign; ignore them.
