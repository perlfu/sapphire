These are release notes for Jikes RVM release 2.3.2.

*Sections of this document:
 *Highlights
 *Other Notes
 *Bug Fixes

*Highlights of this release include:

**Source Code editing support
There are now VIM and Emacs style files supporting the Jikes RVM coding
style for C, Java, and C++.  See rvm/etc/README.  (This should have
been in the 2.3.1 release announcement but was not.)

*Other notes:

*Bug Fixes:
** Fixed crashes in GC on PowerPC/AIX introduced by enabling 
doubleword aligment of long[] and double[] in version 2.3.1. Current
fix is to disable the alignment optimization. (hope to have a better
fix by the time we actually release 2.3.2 --dave).

** Fixed performance problem in profile-directed inlining where the 
AI Organizer forces recompilation of methods in an attempt to inline
runtime service routines that won't be inlined no matter how many
times we try.  Problem has always existed, but became much more severe
in 2.3.0 release when we disabled the inlining of allocation sequences
if the size of the object was not known at compile time.

** Fixed bug in which non-virtualizable interface calls where not being
considered as candidates for feedback-directed inlining.
