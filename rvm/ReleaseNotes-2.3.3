*Highlights of this release include:

**GCspy garbage collection visualization tool

Jikes RVM now includes support for the GCspy tool for visualizing the
garbage collector's behaviour.  Many thanks to Richard Jones of the
University of Kent for this contribution.  (This item should have been
included in the 2.3.2 release notes, but was inadvertently omitted.)
Documentation is in the user's guide.

**Startup time slashed
The startup time for Jikes RVM to run a simple "Hello World" program
on Linux/x86 went down by a factor of 8.  This is because we now use
mmap()'s copy-on-write feature, instead of reading all 30 MB of boot
image into an area mmap()'d with MAP_ANONYMOUS.
(There is a long comment in src/tools/bootImageRunner/IA32/libvm.C
describing this; search for the preprocessor condition #ifdef
MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE).  If this creates problems, disable them by
#undefining MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE in libvm.C.  

This change should be ported to PowerPC Linux by someone who runs that
platform.  Please remove this paragraph if you do so.

**Jikes RVM installable as a production runtime environment
You can install Jikes RVM on your system as a production runtime
environment for Java.  Once you've build Jikes RVM, cd to
src/tools/install and read the file README to find out how to
install a Jikes RVM executable as /usr/bin/rvm (or in some other
location of your choice).
