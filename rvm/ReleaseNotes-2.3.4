These are in-progress release notes for what will be Jikes RVM release
2.3.4.
At the moment they reflect Jikes RVM 2.3.3 + CVS head.

 *Highlights
 *Other Notes
 *Bug Fixes

*Highlights of this release include:

*Other notes:
**The MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE feature now works on PowerPC/Linux and PowerPC/OSX.  
(This feature was discussed in the 2.3.3 release notes.)
**The AttachCurrentThread JNI function is now partly implemented;
it now works in the common case where a thread is already attached to the VM.
**RVM_BOOTCLASSPATH_APPEND is a new environment variable that Jikes RVM
will recognize when booting.  You can use it to add extensions to the
VM.  Set it as you would set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

*Bug Fixes:
**The JNI AttachCurrentThread function now returns proper error status if it
cannot complete properly.  It used to (incorrectly) always return
JNI_OK.
**Class.getResourceAsStream() and Class.getResource() would fail 
with a NullPointerException when invoked on a Class object that was
loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader.
