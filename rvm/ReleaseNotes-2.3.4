These are in-progress release notes for what will be Jikes RVM release
2.3.4.
At the moment they reflect Jikes RVM 2.3.3 + CVS head.


*Sections of this document:
 *Highlights
 *Other Notes
 *Bug Fixes

*Highlights of this release include:
**We now run Eclipse 3.0

*Other notes:
**The MMAP_COPY_ON_WRITE feature now works on PowerPC/Linux and PowerPC/OSX.  
(This feature was discussed in the 2.3.3 release notes.)
**The AttachCurrentThread JNI function is now partly implemented;
it now works in the common case where a thread is already attached to the VM.
**RVM_BOOTCLASSPATH_APPEND is a new environment variable that Jikes RVM
will recognize when booting.  You can use it to add extensions to the
VM.  Set it as you would set the CLASSPATH environment variable.
**Major re-implementation of AOS's feedback-directed inlining and the opt 
compiler's default inlining policy. Result is simpler code, lower
overhead profiling, and more effective inlining decisions. 
*Bug Fixes:
**The JNI AttachCurrentThread function now returns proper error status if it
cannot complete properly.  It used to (incorrectly) always return
JNI_OK.
**Class.getResourceAsStream() and Class.getResource() would fail 
with a NullPointerException when invoked on a Class object that was
loaded by the Bootstrap Class Loader. 
**Defect #3601 is fixed -- java.lang.Thread no longer inherits from VM_Thread.
**Stack trace printing for trouble in the boot thread is fixed; 
it no longer inappropriately elides frames.

*Internal Changes
**Jikes RVM now uses GNU Classpath's java.lang.Class instead of its own.
**The VM_Magic classes have been moved to the org.vmmagic namespace, 
and rationalized.
