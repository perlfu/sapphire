A TODO list for the 2.0.4 release.  Please add more items that you are
aware of and delete items as they are completed.

(1) Stabilize system

(2) Userguide: large sections of the userguide need to be updated for
    the 2.0.4 release.  See the TODO list in doc/userguide.

(3) Memory Manager restructuring:
  -- create two new subdirectories: heap and util and relocate files
     in the top level directory accordingly
  -- stabilize VM_Heap interface
  -- at a minimum javadoc header comments on all classes; javadoc on
     all methods of VM_Heap.

(4) One word object model: ensure that all configurations measured in
    the ecoop'02 paper still work.

(5) All files must have copyright, id, and author tags.  Some of the
    files added since 2.0.3 are missing them.

(6) Write release notes.

(7) Can we distribute the jazzlib jar file from dW like the jlibraries
    jar file?  If so, extend jconfigure to make this work (minimize
    user annoyance at new pre-req).

(8) We could think about having a zero-tolerance for javadoc
    compilation errors starting in 2.0.4.  There are currently about 400
    of them, a few hours of work might be sufficient to fix this.
