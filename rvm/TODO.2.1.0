A TODO list for the 2.1.0 release.  Please add more items that you are
aware of and delete items as they are completed.

(1) Stabilize system
     race conditions introduced by removing VM_ClassLoader.lock

(2) Userguide: large sections of the userguide need to be updated for
    the 2.1.0 release.  See the TODO list in doc/userguide.

DONE (ie close enough for now) (3) Memory Manager restructuring:
  -- stabilize VM_Heap interface
  -- at a minimum javadoc header comments on all classes; javadoc on
     all methods of VM_Heap.

DONE (4) One word object model: ensure that all configurations measured in
    the ecoop'02 paper still work.
  -- verified that BaseBase passes bytecode tests for all variants measured in the paper.

(5) All files must have copyright, id, and author tags.  Some of the
    files added since 2.0.3 are missing them.
    Understand file types,
         eg. Consider applying "@" rules only to .java files 
  Peter

(6) Write release notes.
  ongoing, need to read, enhance

DONE (7) Extend jconfigure to download the jazzlib jar file from ClassPath 
      like the jlibraries jar file.
  Julian, Mike

DONE (8) We could think about having a zero-tolerance for javadoc
    compilation errors starting in 2.1.0.  There are currently about 4
    of them, a few hours of work might be sufficient to fix this.
