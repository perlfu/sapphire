gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch: 

    If you want to build Jikes RVM for Mac OSX, you will need to patch
    your copy (version 0.06 or CVS head) of GNU Classpath with this
    patch file.  Macintosh OSX support was generously contributed by
    Chris Hoffman of the University of Massachusetts.

Skeleton.java

    Skeleton file to use to begin a new Java source file.  Contains
    an IBM copyright notice, Javadoc @author tag, and CVS Id line.

skeleton.C

    Like Skeleton.java but for C source code.

skeleton.sh

    Like Skeleton.java but for Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) source code.


GNUmakefile.skel

    A skeleton initial Makefile to use.  As the Java coding
    conventions suggest, we name our Makefiles "GNUmakefile".  Do the
    same with this one.
