gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch: 

    If you want to build Jikes RVM for Mac OSX, you will need to patch
    your copy (version 0.06 or CVS head) of GNU Classpath with this
    patch file.  Macintosh OSX support was generously contributed by
    Chris Hoffman of the University of Massachusetts.

Skeleton.java

    Skeleton file to use to begin a new Java source file.  Contains
    an IBM copyright notice, Javadoc @author tag, and CVS Id line.

skeleton.C

    Like Skeleton.java but for C source code.

skeleton.sh

    Like Skeleton.java but for Bourne-Again Shell (BASH) source code.

GNUmakefile.skel

    A skeleton initial Makefile to use.  As the Java coding
    conventions suggest, we name our Makefiles "GNUmakefile".  Do the
    same with this one.

jikes-rvm.el

    GNU Emacs source code for editing Jikes RVM source code.  This
    customizes java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since this file will
    probably improve with time, I recommend you load it in rather
    than cutting and pasting its contents into your ~/.emacs file.

dot-emacs.el

    If you're going to edit Jikes RVM C, C++, or Emacs code, I recommend 
    adding the contents of dot-emacs.el, or something similar, to a file in
    your home directory named ~/.emacs.
