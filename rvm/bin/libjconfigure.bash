# tracing() takes 0 or 1 arguments.

# The trace argument can be:
# -trace		 (gets most things but skips the thousands of
#			  lines of bootimagewriter output)
# -trace=ant		# Just ant is of interest
# -trace=jbuild		# high-level
# 
# This is then converted to:
# TRACE_FLAG: (empty)  # only if nothing was said
# TRACE_FLAG: ,no-all,
# TRACE_FLAG: ,-trace,
# We can be tracing any of the following
#	preprocessor,make,BootImageWriter,ant,jbuild
# As well as the groups:
#	most,all
# See the help message in "jbuild -help" for more info.

# Returns true (exit 0) if we are tracing
# Returns false (exit 1) if we are not.
