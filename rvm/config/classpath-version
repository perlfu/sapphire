## Currently we recommend GNU Classpath 0.14 for all platforms except
## OS X, which is still using GNU Classpath 0.10.  These are the only
## versions of Classpath with which this version of Jikes RVM is 
## reguarly tested.  If you try an older version that is still mentioned
## in this file, and it no longer works, please let us know so that we 
## can remove it.  
##
## We think there is a reasonable chance that Jikes RVM will work with
## GNU Classpath versions 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, and 0.14.  Note that GNU Classpath
## 0.14 can't be compiled with jikes 1.19 (the previously recommended 
## version of the jikes bytecode to source compiler).  We now recommend 
## jikes 1.22.

## CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION
## If you built the version of GNU Classpath selected above with the default 
## install directory (if unspecified, "--prefix=/usr/local/classpath" 
## is implied) and installed it with "make install", then uncomment the line 
## below (if it is installed somewhere else, then edit to match). 
#
# export CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION=/usr/local/classpath


## OR, if you built GNU Classpath but haven't 
## installed it (most people haven't), you can set
## CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR to the directory containing the Classpath sources
## *and* set CLASSPATH_BUILD_DIR to the directory
## from which you ran "${CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR}/configure" and ran $GNU_MAKE
# export CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR=${HOME}/JikesRVM/ClasspathCVS/classpath
# export CLASSPATH_BUILD_DIR=${HOME}/JikesRVM/ClasspathCVS/build2

## OR, if you don't have the above, you can *instead* set CLASSPATH_ROOT:

## CLASSPATH_ROOT: Directory containing the unpacked and (optionally built) 
## sources for the version of GNU Classpath selected above.
##
## If you manually downloaded the Classpath sources, then unpack them
## into $CLASSPATH_ROOT and rename the newly extracted source
## directory "classpath-<version-number>" to "classpath".  (If you haven't
## manually downloaded the Classpath sources, then the Jikes RVM build
## process will automatically do so for you, and will use
## CLASSPATH_ROOT if you've set it.)
##
## The Jikes RVM build process will expect to automatically take 
## care of building Classpath from those sources, if you want.
# export CLASSPATH_ROOT=/opt/classpath-<version-number>

## OR you can leave all of the CLASSPATH_ variables unset and let the
## build process download and build GNU Classpath for you.  This
## behaves as if you had set CLASSPATH_ROOT to "$RVM_ROOT/classpath".
## This will work.  I don't recommend doing it more than once, though
## -- if you and others are all working on Jikes RVM, then please just
## put Classpath in one place you can share.
##
## If you want to auto-download GNU Classpath, you will have to make sure
##  that the  variable WGET has a rational value.  (It's only used to
## retrieve GNU Classpath, so you can ignore it otherwise.)
export WGET="/usr/bin/wget"
