# This is the config file that Steven Augart uses to build Jikes RVM
# on his laptop computer, for Jikes RVM builds that include the
# optimizing compiler.  For such builds, I use a previously built
# Jikes RVM to do the template expansion.
#
# This is for the second stage of the two-stage build process for optimizing
# Jikes RVM builds.
