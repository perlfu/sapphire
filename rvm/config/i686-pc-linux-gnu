# target architecutre is IA32
export RVM_FOR_IA32=1

# target OS is Linux
export RVM_FOR_LINUX=1

# Default to 1, since having a hardware SMP running a 2.4 kernal 
# with the appropriate pthread library is currently somewhat unusual.
# NOTE: the key requirement for setting this to 0 (ie having SMP support)
#       is that you have a 2.4 kernel and that glibc is compiled 
#       to use the GS segment register to access pthread-local storage.  
#       See discussion in rvm-researchers archive and the userguide FAQ.
