# This file defines a set of environment variables needed to build and
# run Jikes RVM.  This file is sourced by the installation scripts; you
# do not need to source this file into your command-prompt shell.
#
# IMPORTANT: You need to modify this file to reflect your environment!
#
# This file is pre-configured for x86 hosts running GNU/Linux

#########
# PART I: Preprocessor directives that hold for every config on this target
#
# If you're using Debian GNU/Linux with a 2.2 or 2.4 kernel, then 
# you'll want to enable RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR.  Otherwise, 
# you should not need to change anything in this section.
#########

# The target architecture is Intel x86 (IA32)
export RVM_FOR_IA32=1
export RVM_FOR_32_ADDR=1

# The target OS kernel is Linux
export RVM_FOR_LINUX=1

# NOTE: the key requirement for setting this to 0 (ie having SMP support)
#       is that you have a 2.4 kernel and that glibc is compiled 
#       to use the GS segment register to access pthread-local storage.  
#	(Another way of saying this is that glibc is compiled to 
#	 handle "floating stacks").
#       See the FAQ in the Jikes RVM User's Guide.
#
#       This is now quite common. For example, in Red Hat 7 and later.  
#       So, the default is 0.  The Big Exception is if you are using Debian
#       GNU/Linux with a 2.4 or 2.2 kernel.  Debian with a 2.6 kernel will 
#	work, but it won't work with a 2.4 or 2.2 kernel.
#
export RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=0
## Use this for Debian GNU/Linux with a Linux 2.4 kernel, 
## and for any Linux 2.2 kernel:
# export RVM_FOR_SINGLE_VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR=1

export BOOTIMAGE_LOAD_ADDRESS=0x43000000
export MAXIMUM_MAPPABLE_ADDRESS=0xc0000000

# PART II: Where to find tools and resources on this target
#
# The configuration process can make use of auto-guessing features in
# the RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure program.  You can see the results of
# its guesses in "RVM_BUILD/environment.host".  (This particular file
# doesn't use those features, though, since they won't work if
# you're doing a cross-build.)

# HOST_VM_TYPE=Kaffe
HOST_VM_TYPE=Sun
# HOST_VM_TYPE=JikesRVM	# Does not work yet, due to trouble separating the
			# namespaces of the Builder Jikes RVM and the
			# Jikes RVM being built.	

# Root of JDK installation.
[[ ${HOST_JAVA_HOME-} ]] || HOST_JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/j2se/1.4"

# the JDK java executable
export HOST_VM_RT="$HOST_JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/java"

# 1.4.x JDKs on Linux seem to require that LD_LIBRARY_PATH be set to include
# the JRE's various library paths (otherwise they don't find their .so files 
# when invoked from shell scripts and make).
# Here's how to do it to use HotSpot server with Blackdown 1.4.1
export HOST_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOST_JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/i386/:$HOST_JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/i386/server"
# Here's how to do it to using the IBM 1.4.1 DK 
#export HOST_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOST_JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/classic:$HOST_JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/"

# the JDK Javadoc executable
export HOST_JAVADOC="${HOST_JAVA_HOME}/bin/javadoc"

# the JDK javac executable
export HOST_JAVAC="${HOST_JAVA_HOME}/bin/javac"

# the JDK jar executable

export HOST_TOOLS="${HOST_JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar"

## CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION
## If you built GNU Classpath 0.12 with the default install directory (if
## unspecified, "--prefix=/usr/local/classpath" is implied) and
## installed it with "make install", then uncomment this line:
#
# export CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION=/usr/local/classpath

## If you have classpath 0.10 or Classpath 0.11 already unpacked and built,
## then you can use them instead:

# export CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION=/usr/local/classpath-0.10
# export RVM_WITH_CLASSPATH_0_10=1

# export CLASSPATH_INSTALLATION=/usr/local/classpath-0.11
# export RVM_WITH_CLASSPATH_0_11=1

## OR, if you built GNU Classpath but haven't 
## installed it (most people haven't), you can set
## CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR to the directory containing the Classpath sources
## *and* set CLASSPATH_BUILD_DIR to the directory
## from which you ran "${CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR}/configure" and ran $GNU_MAKE

# export CLASSPATH_SOURCE_DIR=${HOME}/JikesRVM/ClasspathCVS/classpath
# export CLASSPATH_BUILD_DIR=${HOME}/JikesRVM/ClasspathCVS/build2

## OR, if you don't have the above, you can *instead* set CLASSPATH_ROOT:

## CLASSPATH_ROOT: Directory containing the unpacked and (optionally built) 
## sources for GNU Classpath 0.12 (current stable version of Classpath)

## If you manually downloaded the Classpath sources, then unpack them
## into $CLASSPATH_ROOT and rename the newly extracted source
## directory "classpath-0.12" to "classpath".  (If you haven't
## manually downloaded the Classpath sources, then the Jikes RVM build
## process will automatically do so for you, and will use
## CLASSPATH_ROOT if you've set it.)

## The Jikes RVM build process will expect to automatically take 
## care of building Classpath from those sources, if you want.
# export CLASSPATH_ROOT=/opt/classpath-0.12

## OR you can leave all of the CLASSPATH_ variables unset and let the
## build process download and build GNU Classpath for you.  This
## behaves as if you had set CLASSPATH_ROOT to "$RVM_ROOT/classpath".
## This will work.  I don't recommend doing it more than once, though
## -- if you and others are all working on Jikes RVM, then please just
## put Classpath in one place you can share.
## You will also have to make sure that variable WGET has a rational value,
## so tha the downloading will work.  (It's only used to retrieve GNU
## classpath, so you can ignore it otherwise.)

## What C compiler should be used?  We only use the GNU C compiler
## on the project, although it is possible that other compilers might work.
##
## The following long list of warning flags are the warnings that one of the
## project developers always uses when building Jikes RVM.
## Some of these warnings are not present in all versions of GCC.
##  That is why this particular setting of CC is not the default.
#
## We don't usually set -Wundef; Bison's "bison.simple" file refers to
## preprocessor macros.

# PART III: Additional variables for running Eclipse on Jikes RVM
########## 

## Uncomment this and set it to the directory created when you extracted
## eclipse-SDK-3.0-linux-gtk.zip  or eclipse-platform-3.0-linux-gtk.zip 

## (Eclipse extracts itself into a directory named "eclipse",
##  without a version number.)
# export ECLIPSE_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/Eclipse-3.0/eclipse"

## To run Eclipse on Jikes RVM, you will need to use the Xalan XML parser.
## Setting up to use Xalan may also help you run other programs
## under Jikes RVM.
##
## We tested using XALAN 2.6.0; visit http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/
## and download the "Xalan Java binary distribution", since that
## distribution has Xerces packaged with it.  The file is
## xalan-j_2_6_0-bin.tar.gz.

## Unlike how we treat the Classpath .jar file and .so files, we don't
## copy Xalan into $RVM_BUILD.  (We could easily modify the build system to do
## so, though.)
# export XALAN_J_DIR="/usr/local/xalan-j_2_6_0"

## ANT is only used by the jbuild.plugin build script.
## Uncomment this if you have Ant installed, and edit it appropriately.
# export ANT_CMD=$ANT_HOME/bin/ant

##########
# PART IV: Miscellaneous variables.
#
# If you add any variables to this section, please document them.  Please.

# BENCHMARK_ROOT is used in running some of the Jikes RVM regression
# tests.  It doesn't need to be set unless you are running those tests.
