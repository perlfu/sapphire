# PART II: Where to find tools and resources on this target

# The configuration process can make use of auto-guessing features in
# the RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure program.  You can see the results of
# its guesses in "RVM_BUILD/environment.host".  (This particular file
# doesn't use those features, though, since they won't work if
# you're doing a cross-build.)

# PART III: Additional variables for running Eclipse on Jikes RVM

## eclipse-SDK-3.0.1-aix-motif.zip

## (Eclipse extracts itself into a directory named "eclipse",
##  without a version number.)
# export ECLIPSE_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/Eclipse-3.0/eclipse"

## To run Eclipse on Jikes RVM, you will need to use the Xalan XML parser.
## Setting up to use Xalan may also help you run other programs
## under Jikes RVM.
##
## We tested using XALAN 2.6.0; visit http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/
## and download the "Xalan Java binary distribution", since that
## distribution has Xerces packaged with it.  The file is
## xalan-j_2_6_0-bin.tar.gz.

## Unlike how we treat the Classpath .jar file and .so files, we don't
## copy Xalan into $RVM_BUILD.  (We could easily modify the build system to do
## so, though.)
# export XALAN_J_DIR="/usr/local/xalan-j_2_6_0"

## ANT is only used by the jbuild.plugin build script.
