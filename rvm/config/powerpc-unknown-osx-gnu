# PART II: Where to find tools and resources on this target

# The configuration process can make use of auto-guessing features in
# the RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure program.  You can see the results of
# its guesses in "RVM_BUILD/environment.host".  (This particular file
# doesn't use those features, though, since they won't work if
# you're doing a cross-build.)
