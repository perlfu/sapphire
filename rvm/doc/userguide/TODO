(1) Write Jikes RVM overview section.  Includes discussion of package
structure. (Mike).

(5) Write section on HPM (Peter).

(6) Write section on class libraries (includes library support

(8) Rewrite memory management section to describe JMTk.  Either remove

expect to deprecate it soon...
Also update text in installation.tex that discusses selection of
memory managers.
