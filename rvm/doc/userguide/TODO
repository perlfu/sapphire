(1) Write Jikes RVM overview section.  Includes discussion of package
structure. (Mike).

(2) Write section on executing Eclipse on Jikes RVM (Julian).

(4) Write section on JNI (Dave).

(5) Write section on HPM (Peter).

(6) Write section on class libraries (includes library support
package). (Julian)

(8) Rewrite memory management section to describe JMTk.  Either remove
old watson collector text or create two subsections of memory
management (JMTk and watson). If watson remains, need to note that we
expect to deprecate it soon...
Also update text in installation.tex that discusses selection of
memory managers.
