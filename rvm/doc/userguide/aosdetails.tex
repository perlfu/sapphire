For a comprehensive discussion of the design and implementation of the
adaptive optimization system, see our 
\xlink{2000 OOPSLA paper}{\OOPSLAPaperURL}. 

For details on individual classes, see the source files under 
{\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/src/vm/adaptive}.

In summary, version 2.0 of the Jikes\trademark RVM includes basic AOS
functionality to identify and recompile program hot spots,
context-insensitive online profile-directed inlining, and basic
support for dynamic instrumentation.
