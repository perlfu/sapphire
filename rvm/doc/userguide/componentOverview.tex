This subsection briefly describes the overall structure of \jrvm.
Details of the various subsystems are provided in subsequent
sections.  

\subsection{Major Components of \jrvm}


The \jrvm\ can be divided into the following major components:
\begin{description}
\item [Core runtime] (thread scheduler, class loader, library support,
verifier, etc.) This component is responsible for 
managing all the underlying data
structures required to execute applications and interfacing with
libraries.

\item [Compilers] (baseline, optimizing, JNI) This component is
responsible for generating executable code from bytecodes.

\item [Memory managers] This component is responsible for the
allocation and collection of objects during the execution of an
application. 

\item [Adaptive optimization system] This component is responsible
for profiling an executing application
and judiciously using the optimizing compiler to
improve its performance.
\end{description}

More details of each of these components are provided in the following sections.

\subsection{Package Structure}
The 2.2.0 release introduced packages into the system.  Prior releases
did not use packages explicitly, which resulted in all classes being in
the unnamed package.  

There are currently seven packages in \jrvm. All classes are in
one of these packages.
\begin{description}
\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM] Classes for the core runtime, except for library
support.  This package also contains other classes that are not
included in one of the other packages, such as the baseline and JNI
compilers. 

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.librarySupport] Classes for library support
\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.adaptive] Classes for the adaptive optimization system

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.memoryManagers.vmInterface] Classes related to
memory management that deal with the interface to the VM

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.memoryManagers.JMTk] Classes in the newer JMTk
(Java Memory Management Toolkit) collection of memory managers

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.memoryManagers.watson] Classes in the older
Watson collection of memory managers

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.opt] Classes related to the optimizing
compiler, except for IR-related classes

\item [com.ibm.JikesRVM.opt.ir] Classes related to the IR
(intermediate representation) of the optimizing compiler
\end{description}

The distributed directory structure
does not follow the Java convention that the location of source file
be correlated with the package structure, i.e.,
there is no {\tt com/ibm/JikesRVM} directory anywhere under {\tt
rvmRoot}.  Instead, a more logical structure of the source
files is used.  One step of building a boot image
is copying the source files from the rvmRoot tree into a build
directory.  The scripts that perform this copy create the directory
structure required by Java semantics and place classes in appropriate
directories.

This approach avoids the need to change the directory structure as the
package structure evolves to become more fine-grained. If we
eventually arrive at a more fine-grained package structure (so that
each package contains a reasonably small number of classes) we may
convert the source tree to a package-oriented structure to facilitate
using standard Java IDE's to edit Jikes RVM source code.
