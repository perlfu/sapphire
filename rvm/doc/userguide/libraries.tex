As of version 2.2.0, Jikes\JikesTMFootnote\ RVM has mostly switched to
using the \xlink{GNU Classpath}{\classpathURL} class libraries.  The
default library configuration is a ``hybrid'' configuration that uses
the original OTI-derived class libraries for the {\tt java.lang}, {\tt
java.lang.ref}, {\tt java.lang.reflect}, {\tt java.util}, {\tt
java.io}, and {\tt java.net} packages.  All other packages come from
GNU Classpath.

There is also an experimental ``pure'' configuration that uses only
the GNU Classpath class libraries. Although we are moving towards
making the classpath-only configuration the default for Jikes RVM, it
is not yet ready for general use. We hope to make this the default in
the near future.

Some library classes require special VM support.  This is provided by
{\tt com.ibm.JikesRVM.librarySupport} and the classes found in
{\tt rvm/src/vm/OTILibrarySupport} and {\tt rvm/src/vm/GNUClasspathSupport}.
