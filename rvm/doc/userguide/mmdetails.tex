This section provides additional information on the implementation
of the memory management component of Jikes\trademark RVM runtime system.

Version 2.2.0 of Jikes RVM introduces JMTk, a new family of memory
managers. JMTk is described in the next section. A few of the original
watson collectors are still included in Jikes RVM 2.2.0 but are
scheduled for removal in the 2.2.1 release.  Only the Semispace and
MarkSweep watson collectors have been regularly tested.
