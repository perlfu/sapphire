This Section provides additional information on the implementation
of the memory management component of RVM runtime system.
 
\subsection{Directory Structure} \label{sssec:directories}
The classes related to memory management are contained in the 
{\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/src/vm/memoryManagers} directory.
The {\tt watson} sub-directory of {\tt memoryManagers} contains
the memory managers provided with the initial release of the RVM,
and are the managers discussed in this section.

The {\tt watson} directory contains common classes used by multiple
memory managers, such as the load balancing work queue
(see 
\xlink{{\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue.java}}{\VMGCWorkQueueURL}
).
Sub-directories of {\tt watson} 
contain classes for a specific memory management strategy.
For example, the {\tt semispace} directory implements a
simple semi-space copying allocator and collector.

A RVM configuration specifies a memory management strategy, 
and the jconfigure command will include in the build all the
classes in the {\tt memoryManagers/watson} directory and all the classes in the
sub-directory for the specified memory management strategy.

\subsection{Choosing an Allocator/Collector} \label{ssec:choosinggc}
Depending on your purposes, you may choose to build RVM
with a semispace copying, mark-sweep noncopying, or hybrid collector.
For programs which do not perform many collections, the
copying collector will most likely perform best, since object
allocation path lengths are shortest for this collector.  To
minimize garbage collection delays, the hybrid collector may
be used, since it allows a small nursery for which minor collections
can be quite fast, and major collections are noncopying.  

Generally, the mark-sweep noncopying
collector requires smaller heap storage for a given application	
than any of the copying collectors, which in have a semispace structure.
Also, major collections are faster with a noncopying collector,
since objects are not moved.  The best performance for a particular	
application should be determined by experiment.

All of the memory managers provided in the {\tt watson} directory,
except for the concurrent (reference counting) collector, support
finalization, and collection while threads are executing in 
native code (such threads are blocked in native code during collection).

\subsection{Adding A New Allocator/Collector} \label{sssec:newalloc}
\index{garbage collection}
\index{stop-the-world garbage collection}
It is not difficult to add your own Allocator/Collector to RVM,
especially if it uses the same ``stop the world'' parallel collection
strategy used by all the collectors in this release.  The basic steps
are:
\index{jconfigure script}
\index{VM\_Allocator class}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new directory for the Allocator/Collector, such as ``newGC''.
\item Add a new configuration in {\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/config/build}
which includes your new directory in the build.  Name it appropriately, such as
``BaseBasenewGC''.
\item Copy some existing {\tt VM\_Allocator.java} file into your new directory,
and modify it, choosing one that has similar properties, such as copying or
non-copying.  If you want to start from scratch, start with 
{\tt VM\_Allocator} in noGC.
This file provides simple implementations of the required object allocation
methods, and stubs for the other fields and methods expected by the rest
of the RVM runtime (not all will be needed in any one implementation).
With the initial set of memory managers, a single class, VM\_Allocator, implements both
the methods that perform object allocation and the methods that perform
garbage collections.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Load Balancing Work Queue} \label{sssec:workqueue}
\index{VM\_GCWorkQueue class}
\index{finalizable objects}
\index{finalizer method}
The class {\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue}, implements a load balancing workqueue
which is used by all the collectors to find all references reachable from
some initial set of references.  It is used to find all objects reachable
from roots, and also to find all objects reachable from finalizable objects
that are made live in order to execute their finalizer methods.

The work queue is implemented using thread local ``get'' and ``put'' buffers
and a shared pool of buffers needing to be processed.  The performance of the
work queue is affected by the size of these buffers.  The default size is 1024 
entries, but can be altered by the command line argument ``-X:wbsize=nnn'' where
nnn is the maximum number of entries in the buffer.  When running with multiple
processors, better load balancing has been observed with smaller buffers, for
example with 256 entries per buffer.  

\subsection{Generational Write Barrier} \label{sssec:writebarrier}
\index{VM\_WriteBuffer class}
\index{write buffer}
\index{write barrier}
\index{object header}
RVM provides a class {\tt VM\_WriteBarrier} to support generational garbage 
collection.
When the static 
final field {\tt VM\_Allocator.writeBarrier} is true,
the RVM compilers generate write barriers.
The baseline compiler generates calls to barrier methods in {\tt VM\_WriteBarrier}.
The optimizing compiler inlines the same barrier methods.

The logic of the write barrier is implemented in {\tt VM\_WriteBarrier}.
The RVM generational collectors all use the same write barrier.
It stores into a processor local write buffer the address of an object
into which a ref is being stored.
A bit in the object header identifies objects that need to be recorded.
The barrier logic turns off the bit when an object is written to the write
buffer, to avoid duplicate entries.
During garbage collection, collectors must set these bits back on so that
subsequent stores into the object will cause it to be recorded.

Alternative write barriers can be implemented. For example, the concurrent
reference counting collector uses a barrier that records both old and new
references for each store of a reference into an object. It does this
by building with its own version of VM\_WriteBarrier.

The RVM generational collectors treat all objects which
survive one garbage collection as old, and do not maintain ``remembered sets''
of old objects between collections.

\subsection{Starting Garbage Collection} \label{sssec:startgc}
\index{VM\_Handshake class}
\index{VM\_CollectorThread class}
\index{stop-the-world garbage collection}
\index{concurrent garbage collection}
The stopping of mutator threads and the scheduling of the collector
threads is handled by the classes 
{\tt VM\_Handshake} and {\tt VM\_CollectorThread}.
Mutator threads initiate collection by calling the {\tt collect} method
of {\tt VM\_CollectorThread} which causes collector threads to be scheduled
on all the {\tt VM\_Processor}s, and then yields, to allow the collector thread
on the executing processor to be scheduled.
Parallel execution of collector threads is synchronized by rendezvous.
During the initial rendezvous, one of the collector threads detects
processors whose executing thread is blocked in native code, and makes
these processors ``non-participating'' for that collection.
Collection begins when all ``participating'' collector threads
arrive at the initial rendezvous.
After the initial rendezvous, the participating collector threads
call the {\tt collect} method of {\tt VM\_Allocator}.  They execute
in parallel in this method until collection is complete.  By default,
there is one collector thread for each {\tt VM\_Processor} (system thread).
While collection is in progress, all non-collector threads are suspended
in queues of the {\tt VM\_Processors} waiting to be re-dispatched.

To implement other than stop-the-world parallel collection 
(such as was done with the concurrent collector) then it will be necessary to modify
or extend the {\tt VM\_Handshake} and {\tt VM\_CollectorThread} classes.

\subsection{Measuring Collector Performance} \label{sssec:verbosegc}
\index{command-line arguments}
\index{VM\_Allocator class}
When the ``-verbose:gc'' command line argument is specified, the time
spent in each collection will be written out after each collection.
In addition, summary statistics are generated when RVM exits, which
specify the number of collections, and average and maximum collection times.
For generational collectors, this is given for Minor and Major collections.
Some collectors provide additional information, that can be measured
with minimal cost, such a number of bytes copied for the copying collectors.

Compile time flags can be set to cause additional information, at additional
cost, to be measured and reported.  Some of the more useful ones are
described here, others are described in the various {\tt VM\_Allocator}
source files.

\paragraph{TIME\_GC\_PHASES}
This flag will cause the collector to measure the time spent in each
of the phases of garbage collection, such as stopping mutators, finding roots,
marking reachable objects, and finalization.  Turning on this flag will cause
the summary statistics, with average times in each phase, to be generated 
when RVM exits.  If {\tt -verbose:gc} is specified the output is generated after
each collection. Turning on {\tt TIME\_GC\_PHASES} in the common 
{\tt VM\_CollectorThread}
class will cause it to be set in what ever 
{\tt VM\_Allocator} is being used.

\paragraph{MEASURE\_WAIT\_TIMES}
This flag will cause the collector to measure the time each collector thread
spends waiting during a collection.  This is time waiting for buffers while
processing the Work Queue, and time waiting in rendezvous between phases of the
collection process. Turning on this flag will cause
the summary statistics, with average wait times, to be generated 
when RVM exits.  If -verbose:gc is specified the output is generated after
each collection, for each collector thread.
Turning on {\tt MEASURE\_WAIT\_TIMES} in the common {\tt
VM\_CollectorThread}
class will cause necessary flags in {\tt VM\_Allocator} and 
{\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue} to be set.

\begin{description}
\item[RENDEZVOUS\_TIMES] prints per thread entrance and exit times for the
rendezvous during each collection.
\item[GC\_COUNT\_BY\_TYPES] prints counts of the number of live objects grouped
by type.
\item[WORK\_QUEUE\_COUNTS] counts work queue buffers processed by each collector
thread (in VM\_GCWorkQueue). 
\item[COUNT\_GETS\_AND\_PUTS] counts object references processed by each collector
thread (in VM\_GCWorkQueue). 
\end{description}
Not all flags are available in all VM\_Allocator files.
