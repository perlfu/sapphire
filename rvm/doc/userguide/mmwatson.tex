\subsubsection{Directory Structure} 
The classes related to memory management are contained in the 
{\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/src/vm/memoryManagers}  directory.
The  {\tt watson}  sub-directory of  {\tt memoryManagers}  contains
the original memory managers provided with the Jikes RVM
and are described in this section.  

In {\tt watson}, the {\tt common} subdirectory contains classes used by multiple
memory managers, such as the load balancing work queue
(see \xlink{{\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue.java}}{\VMGCWorkQueueURL})
and write buffers {\tt VM\_WriteBuffer}.
Other sub-directories of {\tt watson} 
contain classes specific to a particular memory management strategy.
Currently, there are 4 collectors supported: 
a semi-space copying collector (in {\tt semispace}),
a generational copying collector (in {\tt copyGen}), 
a non-generational mark-sweep collector (in {\tt markSweep}), 
and a generational hybrid collector in which the nursery is managed by copying collection
and the older generation is managed by mark-sweep collection (in {\tt hybrid}).

Each Jikes RVM configuration specifies a memory management strategy, 
and the  {\tt jconfigure}   command will include in the build all the
common classes in the {\tt memoryManagers/watson} directory and 
all the classes in the sub-directory comprising the specified memory management strategy.

\subsubsection{Choosing a Garbage Collector}
Depending on your purposes, you may choose to build Jikes RVM with a
semispace copying, mark-sweep noncopying, or hybrid collector.  For
programs that do not perform many collections, the copying collector
will most likely perform best, since object allocation path lengths
are shortest for this collector.  On the other hand, a copying
collector will generally require more memory than a mark-sweep
collector to achieve the same overhead. For minimizing garbage
collection delays, the hybrid collector may be used, since it allows a
small nursery for which minor collections can be quite fast, and major
collections are non-copying.  The best performance for a particular
application should be determined by experiment.

All of the memory managers provided in the {\tt watson} directory
% except for the concurrent (reference counting) collector, 
support finalization.  Moreover, a collection can proceed even 
when some threads are executing in native code. When a collection 
starts, threads in native code are blocked from returning to Java code
for the duration of that collection.

\subsubsection{Writing A New Garbage Collector}
\index{garbage collection}
\index{stop-the-world garbage collection}
It is not difficult to add your own memory manager (allocator and collector) to Jikes RVM,
especially if it uses the same ``stop the world'' parallel collection
strategy used by all the collectors in this release.  The basic steps
are:
\index{jconfigure script}
\index{VM\_Allocator class}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new directory for the collector, such as ``NewGC''.
\item Add a new configuration in {\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/config/build}
which includes your new directory in the build.  Name it appropriately, such as
``BaseBaseNewGC''.
\item Modify {\tt \$RVM\_ROOT/rvm/bin/jconfigure} to handle the new collector sub-directory.
\item Copy some existing {\tt VM\_Allocator.java} file into your new directory,
and modify it, choosing one that has similar properties, such as copying or
non-copying.  If you want to start from scratch, use {\tt VM\_Allocator.java} in noGC.
This file provides simple implementations of the required object allocation
methods, and stubs for the other fields and methods expected by the rest
of the Jikes RVM runtime (not all will be needed in any one implementation).
A single class {\tt VM\_Allocator} implements both
the methods that perform object allocation and the methods that perform
garbage collections.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Load Balancing Work Queue}
\index{VM\_GCWorkQueue class}
\index{finalizable objects}
\index{finalizer method}
The class {\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue} implements a load balancing work-queue
which is used by all the collectors to find all references reachable from
some initial set of references.  After the initial root scan, the work queue
should hold all gray objects ({\it i.e.} objects that require scanning or further
processing).

The work queue consists a pair of local buffers (``get'' and ``put'') for each GC thread
and a globally shared pool of buffers containing objects that need to be processed.  
The performance of the work queue is affected by the size of these buffers.  
The default size is 1024 entries, but can be altered by the command line argument ``{\tt -X:wbsize=nnn}'' 
where {\tt nnn} is the maximum number of entries in the buffer.  When running with multiple
processors, better load balancing has been observed with smaller buffer sizes ({\it e.g}. 256).

\subsubsection{Generational Write Barrier}
\index{VM\_WriteBuffer class}
\index{write buffer}
\index{write barrier}
\index{object header}
Jikes RVM provides a class {\tt VM\_WriteBarrier} to support generational garbage collection.
When the static final field {\tt VM\_Allocator.writeBarrier} is true,
the Jikes RVM compilers will generate write barriers by calling or inlining the methods in
{\tt VM\_WriteBarrier}.

Currently, the generational collectors are the only ones requiring a write barrier
and they all use the same one.  Examination of {\tt VM\_WriteBarrier.java} shows
that the write barrier consists of conditionally storing the address of the modified object
into a per-processor sequential write buffer.  For optimization, a {\it barrier bit} in the object header
has been reserved to help eliminate unnecessary write buffer entries.
When an object is allocated or processed during collection, the barrier bit is set.
When an object is modified, the write barrier checks to see if the barrier bit is set.
If so, the object is added into the write buffer entry and the barrier bit is cleared.
Otherwise, the object has already been added to some write buffer and no action is required.
It is important for a garbage collector to set the barrier bits so that
subsequent stores into the object will not be lost.

The Jikes RVM generational collectors treat all objects which survive one garbage collection as old
and performs {\it en masse} promotion.  Thus, they do not need to maintain ``remembered sets''
of old objects to record intergenerational references between collections.

\subsubsection{Starting Garbage Collection}
\index{VM\_Handshake class}
\index{VM\_CollectorThread class}
\index{stop-the-world garbage collection}
\index{concurrent garbage collection}
Collector scheduling and suspension of mutator threads is
handled by the classes {\tt VM\_Handshake} and {\tt VM\_CollectorThread}.
A mutator thread initiates collection by calling the {\tt collect} method
of {\tt VM\_CollectorThread} which causes all collector threads to be scheduled
on the {\tt VM\_Processor}'s, and then yields to allow the collector thread
on the executing processor to be scheduled.  During garbage collection, thread
switching is disabled so the mutator does not execute until collection is completed.
Parallel execution of collector threads is synchronized by barrier synchronization or
rendezvous.  During the initial rendezvous, one of the collector threads detects
processors whose executing thread is blocked in native code, and makes
these processors ``non-participating'' for that collection.
Collection begins when all ``participating'' collector threads
have arrived at the initial rendezvous.  At all but the first rendezvous,
it is known how many processors are expected to arrive at the barrier.
Collection proper begins when the participating collector threads
call the {\tt collect} method of {\tt VM\_Allocator}.  They execute
in parallel in this method until collection is complete.  By default,
there is one collector thread for each {\tt VM\_Processor} (system thread).

Note that to implement a non-parallel collector, 
the configuration must define the variable {\tt RVM\_WITH\_SINGLE\_VIRTUAL\_PROCESSOR}.
Also, to implement a concurrent or incremental collector,
% (such as was done with the concurrent collector) 
it will be necessary to modify or extend the {\tt VM\_Handshake} and {\tt VM\_CollectorThread} classes.

\subsubsection{Measuring Collector Performance}
\index{command-line arguments}
\index{VM\_Allocator class}
When the ''{\tt -verbose:gc}'' command line argument is specified, the time
spent in each collection will be written out after each collection.
In addition, summary statistics are generated when VM exits.  These include
the number of collections, and the average and maximum collection times.
For generational collectors, the times are grouped by minor and major collections.
Some collectors provide additional information.  For example,
the copying collectors include the number of bytes copied.
For more information, one can use the ''{\tt -verbose:gc=nnn}'' where {\tt nnn} indicates the level of 
verbosity.  When no level is given, level 1 is assumed.
Note that the more output there is, the more skewed the time measurements may become.

At verbosity level 2, the collector will show the time spent in each
of the phases of garbage collection, such as stopping mutators,
finding roots, marking reachable objects, and finalization.  For each
phase the time is shown at the end of each collection and the summary
statistics shown when the VM exits.  Since the cost of timing phases
is minimal, it is always performed.

Compile-time flags can be set to cause additional information, at additional
cost, to be measured and reported.  Some of the more useful ones are
described here, others are described in the various {\tt VM\_Allocator}
source files.

\begin{description}
\item[MEASURE\_WAIT\_TIMES]
When this flag, which is in {\tt VM\_CollectorThread}, is enabled, 
the collector will measure the time each collector thread
spends waiting during a collection.  This includes time waiting for buffers while
processing the work queue, and time waiting in rendezvous between phases of the
collection process. Turning on this flag will cause
the summary statistics, with average wait times, to be generated when VM exits.  
If ``{\tt -verbose:gc}'' is specified the output is generated after each collection.

\item[COUNT\_BY\_TYPES and COUNT\_BY\_ALLOCATIONS]
These two flags control GC profiling and both flags have significant runtime cost.
When {\tt COUNT\_BY\_ALLOCATIONS} is enabled, the allocation code will track the number
of bytes allocated, the number of objects allocated, and the number of objects that have
lock fields.  When {\tt COUNT\_BY\_TYPES} is set, a group of per-type counters are enabled
tracking both allocation and GC processing.

\item[WORKQUEUE\_COUNTS]
This flag is located in {\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue} and controls the counting of work queue buffers
processed by each collector thread.

\item[COUNT\_GETS\_AND\_PUTS]
This flag is located in {\tt VM\_GCWorkQueue} and controls the counting of object references 
processed by each collector.
