This section provides some tips on collecting performance numbers with
Jikes RVM.\@

\index{boot image}
\index{configurations}
\subsection{Which boot image should I use?}

To make a long story short the best performing configuration of Jikes
RVM will almost always be {\tt production}.  Unless you really know
what you are doing, don't use any other configuration to do a
performance evaluation of Jikes RVM.\@ 

Any boot image you use for performance evaluation must have the
following characteristics for the results to be meaningful:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\tt RVM\_WITHOUT\_ASSERTIONS=1}. Unless this is set, the runtime
system and optimizing compiler will perform fairly extensive assertion
checking. This introduces significant runtime overhead. By convention,
a configuration with the {\tt Fast} prefix disables assertion
checking.
\item {\tt RVM\_WITH\_OPT\_BOOTIMAGE\_COMPILER=1}. Unless this is set, the
boot image will be compiled with the baseline compiler and virtual
machine performance will be abysmal.  Jikes RVM has been designed
under the assumption that aggressive inlining and optimization will be
applied to the VM source code. 
\item Any configuration that performs opt compilation at runtime (
{\tt RVM\_\-WITH\_\-A\-DAP\-TIVE\_\-SYS\-TEM=1} should be built with {\tt
RVM\_\-WITH\_\-ALL\_\-CLAS\-SES=1}.  This includes the optimizing compiler and
associated support classes in the boot image where they can be
optimized by the boot image compiler. By convention, configurations
that include the opt compiler in the boot image have the {\tt Full} or
{\tt Fast} prefix.  Configurations where {\tt RVM\_WITH\_ALL\_CLASSES}
is not set to 1 that use the optimizing compiler will dynamically load
it (which will force it to be baseline compiled).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What command-line arguments should I use?}

For best performance we recommend the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt -processors all}: By default, Jikes\TMweb{} RVM uses only
one processor.  Setting this option tells the runtime system to
utilize all available processors. 
\item Set the heap size generously.  We typically set the heap size to
at least half the physical memory on a machine. 
\item Use a dedicated machine with no other users.  The Jikes RVM
thread and synchronization implementation do not play well with
others. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Jikes RVM is really slow! What am I doing wrong?}

Perhaps you are not seeing stellar Jikes\TMweb{} RVM performance.
If Jikes RVM as described above is not competitive with the IBM
AIX\TMweb{} or Linux\Rweb/x86-32 product DK, we recommend you test
your installation with the SPECjvm\TMweb{}98 benchmarks.  We expect Jikes RVM
performance to be competitive with the IBM\Rweb{} DK 1.3.0 on the SPECjvm98
benchmarks.

Of course, SPECjvm98 does not guarantee that Jikes RVM runs all codes
well.  We have also tested various flavors of pBOB and the Volano
benchmarks, and usually see superior or competitive performance.

The x86-32\-/\-IA-32 port is somewhat less mature than the PPC port, and does not
deliver competitive performance on some codes.  In particular, x86
floating-point performance is mediocre.

\T \pagebreak[4]
Some kinds of code will not run fast on Jikes RVM.\@  Known issues include:
\T \nopagebreak
\begin{itemize}
\item Jikes RVM start-up is slow compared to the IBM product JVM.\@
\item Remember that the non-adaptive configurations (eg. Fast) opt-compile
{\em every} method the first time it executes.  With aggressive optimization
levels, opt-compiling will severely slow down the first execution of
each method.  For many benchmarks, it is possible to test the quality
of generated code by either running for several iterations and ignoring
the first, or by building a warm-up period into the code.  The SPEC benchmarks
already use these strategies.  The adaptive configuration does not
have this problem; however, we cannot stipulate that the adaptive
system will compete with the product on short-running codes of a few seconds.
\item We expect Jikes RVM to perform well on codes with many threads, such as
VolanoMark.  However, if you have a code with many threads, each using
JNI, Jikes RVM performance will suffer due to factors in the design of
the current thread system.
\index{quasi-preemption}
\item Performance on tight loops may suffer.  The Jikes RVM thread system
relies on quasi-preemption; the optimizing compiler inserts a thread-switch
test on every back edge.  This will hurt tight loops, including many
simple microbenchmarks.  We should someday alleviate this problem by
strip-mining and hoisting the yield point out of hot loops.
\item The thread system currently uses a spinning idle thread. If a
Jikes RVM
virtual processor (ie., pthread) has no work to do, it spins chewing up
cpu cycles.  Thus, Jikes RVM will only perform well if there is no other activity on the machine.
\item The load balancing in the system is naive and unfair.  This can hurt some styles of codes, including bulk-synchronous parallel programs.
\item The adaptive system may not perform well on SMPs; this may be due to bad
interaction with the thread load balancer.
\end{itemize}

The Jikes RVM developers wish to ensure that Jikes RVM delivers
competitive performance.
