gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch: 

    If you want to build Jikes RVM for Mac OSX, you will need to patch
    your copy (version 0.06 or CVS head) of GNU Classpath with this
    patch file.  Macintosh OSX support was generously contributed by
    Chris Hoffman of the University of Massachusetts.

    Skeleton initial files to use.

jikes-rvm.el

    GNU Emacs source code for editing Jikes RVM source code.  This
    customizes java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since this file will
    probably improve with time, I recommend you load it in rather
    than cutting and pasting its contents into your ~/.emacs file.

dot-emacs.el

    If you're going to edit Jikes RVM C, C++, or Emacs code, I recommend 
    adding the contents of dot-emacs.el, or something similar, to a file in
    your home directory named ~/.emacs.
