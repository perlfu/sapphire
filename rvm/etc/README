classpath-0.08-sizeof-void-p.patch

    If you want to build Jikes RVM for the 64-bit PowerPC, you will
    need to patch your copy of GNU Classpath 0.08 with this patch
    file, or else Double.toString() won't work.  Thanks to Sergiy
    Kyrylkov for tracking down the problem.

gnu-classpath-on-mac-osx.patch: 

    If you want to build Jikes RVM for Mac OSX, you will need to patch
    your copy (version 0.08 or CVS head) of GNU Classpath with this
    patch file.  Macintosh OSX support is by Chris Hoffman of the
    University of Massachusetts. 

skel/: 

    Skeleton initial files to use.

jikes-rvm.el

    GNU Emacs customizations for editing Jikes RVM source code.  This
    customizes Java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since this file will
    probably improve with time, I recommend you use (load) or
    (load-library) to bring it in indirectly from the Jikes RVM
    source tree, rather than cutting and pasting its contents into
    your ~/.emacs file.  See dot-emacs.el below.

dot-emacs.el

    If you're going to edit Jikes RVM C, C++, or Emacs code, I recommend 
    adding the contents of dot-emacs.el, or something similar, to a file in
    your home directory named "~/.emacs".

jikes-rvm.vim

    Vim (Vi IMproved) customizations for editing Jikes RVM source
    code.  This customizes Java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since
    this file will probably improve with time, I recommend you load it
    in indirectly from the source tree rather than cutting and pasting
    its contents into your ~/.vimrc file.  See dot-vimrc.vim below.

dot-vimrc.vim

    If you're going to use the Jikes RVM Vim customizations, we recommend
    adding the contents of dot-vimrc.vim to a file in your home
    directory named "~/.vimrc".
