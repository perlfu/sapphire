    Skeleton initial files to use.

jikes-rvm.el

    GNU Emacs customizations for editing Jikes RVM source code.  This
    customizes Java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since this file will
    probably improve with time, I recommend you use (load) or
    (load-library) to bring it in indirectly from the Jikes RVM
    source tree, rather than cutting and pasting its contents into
    your ~/.emacs file.  See dot-emacs.el below.

dot-emacs.el

    If you're going to edit Jikes RVM C, C++, or Emacs code, I recommend 
    adding the contents of dot-emacs.el, or something similar, to a file in
    your home directory named "~/.emacs".

jikes-rvm.vim

    Vim (Vi IMproved) customizations for editing Jikes RVM source
    code.  This customizes Java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since
    this file will probably improve with time, I recommend you load it
    in indirectly from the source tree rather than cutting and pasting
    its contents into your ~/.vimrc file.  See dot-vimrc.vim below.

dot-vimrc.vim

    If you're going to use the Jikes RVM Vim customizations, we recommend
    adding the contents of dot-vimrc.vim to a file in your home
    directory named "~/.vimrc".
