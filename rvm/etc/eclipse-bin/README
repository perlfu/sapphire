This directory contains a program named "java", which is what Eclipse
3.0 expects.  To run eclipse, under Jikes RVM, make sure that you run
the "eclipse" executable with this directory appearing before any
other directory containing a "java" program.

If you use "rvmeclipse", that will be done for you.
