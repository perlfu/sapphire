;;; C, C++, and Java style for editing Jikes RVM source code.  This
;;; customizes Java mode, C++ mode, and C mode.  Since this file will
;;; probably improve with time, I recommend you load it in rather
;;; than cutting and pasting its contents into your ~/.emacs file.
;;;
;;; @author Steven Augart
;;; @date May 20, 2003, through November 21, 2003 (work in progress)

;;; This style is designed to work nicely with the functions
;;; `c-toggle-auto-state' and `c-toggle-hungry-state'.

;; To use this file, see the file "dot-emacs.el" in this directory.
