# This script will build the boot images
## 
## By giving the "-wait sem" flags to NightSanityDriver, it tells
## NightSanityDriver to create a semaphore file in each build in the
## images directory, upon completion of each build.  night-sanity-run
## then uses that information to know when it's OK to start the tests
## that use that particular image.
