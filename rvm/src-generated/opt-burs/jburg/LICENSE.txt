----------------
Jikes RVM Addendum.

We have modified Iburg in two ways:
 (1) We modified the input patterns it accepts to be consistent with
our intermediate representation.
 (2) We modified it to produce Java code instead of C code.

All bug reports related to the use of jburg in building Jikes RVM
should be reported to the Jikes RVM project and _not_ to David
R. Hanson or the iburg project.  Please report them using the the
normal Jikes RVM bug reporting channels.
