V maxSystemTroubleRecursionDepth int  3
If we get deeper than this in one of the System Trouble functions, try to die.


# NOTE: Although this option can be set to arbitrary values,
#       setting it to a smaller quantum than what is actually supported
#       by pthread nanosleep on the target platform will reduce the
#       effectiveness of the Adaptive System.  Therefore, this setting
#       should be verified by running a relatively long running program
#       on an unload machine and enabling -X:aos:reportInterruptStats=true
