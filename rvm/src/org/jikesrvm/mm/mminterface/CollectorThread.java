 * System thread used to perform garbage collections.
 *
 * These threads are created by VM.boot() at runtime startup. One is created for
 * each Processor that will (potentially) participate in garbage collection.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Its &quot;run&quot; method does the following:
 *    1. wait for a collection request
 *    2. synchronize with other collector threads (stop mutation)
 *    3. reclaim space
 *    4. synchronize with other collector threads (resume mutation)
 *    5. goto 1
 * </pre>
 *
 * Between collections, the collector threads reside on the Scheduler
 * collectorQueue. A collection in initiated by a call to the static
 * {@link #collect} method, which calls
 * {@link Handshake#requestAndAwaitCompletion} to dequeue the collector
 * threads and schedule them for execution. The collection commences when all
 * scheduled collector threads arrive at the first "rendezvous" in the run
 * methods run loop.
 *
 * An instance of Handshake contains state information for the "current"
 * collection. When a collection is finished, a new Handshake is allocated
 * for the next garbage collection.
