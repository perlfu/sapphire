/**
 * Constants used to implement thin locks.
 * A portion of a word, either in the object header
 * or in some other location, is used to provide light weight
 * synchronization operations. This class defines
 * how the bits available for thin locks are allocated.
 * Either a lock is in fat state, in which case it looks like
 * 1Z..Z where Z..Z is the id of a heavy lock, or it is in
 * thin state in which case it looks like 0I..IC..C where
 * I is the thread id of the thread that owns the lock and
 * C is the recursion count of the lock.
