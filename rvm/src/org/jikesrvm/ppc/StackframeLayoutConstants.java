 *--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *                     Stackframe layout conventions
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A stack is an array of "slots", declared formally as 4 bytes on 32bit architectures
 * and 8 bytes on 64bit architectures, each slot
 * containing either a primitive (byte, int, float, etc), an object pointer,
 * a machine code pointer (a return address pointer), or a pointer to another
 * slot in the same stack (a frame pointer). The interpretation of a slot's
 * contents depends on the current value of IP, the machine instruction
 * address register.
 * Each machine code generator provides maps, for use by the garbage collector,
 * that tell how to interpret the stack slots at "safe points" in the
 * program's execution.<p>
 *
 * Here's a picture of what a stack might look like in memory.<p>
 *
 * Note: this (array) object is drawn upside down compared to other objects
 * because the hardware stack grows from high memory to low memory, but
 * array objects are laid out from low memory to high (header first).

 *
 * On the 64 bit powerPC some design decisions were made as follows:<p>
 *
 * An Address, Float and Integer-Like types take 1 slot of 8 bytes.
 * The 4 byte quantities resides in the least significant half of the slot,
 * which is at side of the higher addresses.
 * A Long and a Double take 2 slots of 8 bytes, one of which is not used:
 * the actual value is also stored at the side of the highest addresses.<p>
