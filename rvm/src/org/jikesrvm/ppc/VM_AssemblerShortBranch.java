 * This class was formerly a private static inner class of VM_Assembler, but has
 * been pulled out to work around a bug whereby the system seems to have gotten
 * confused by the relationship between:
 * 
 * VM_ForwardReference -> VM_ForwardReference.ShortBranch -> VM_Assembler.ShortBranch, and VM_Assembler
 * 
 * This problem does not exist under IA32 since there is no need for VM_Assembler.ShortBranch
