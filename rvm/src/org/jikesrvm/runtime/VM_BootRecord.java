/**
 * Information required to start the virtual machine and communicate
 * with the outside world.
 *
 * <p> The virtual machine image consists entirely of java objects.
 * The first java-object, the boot record, is the communication area between
 * the host operating system and the virtual machine. It consists of read-only
 * fields containing startup information used by the assembler bootstrap
 * loader, by the virtual machine's initializer methods, and by the virtual
 * machine's operating system call interface methods.
 *
 * <p> See also: BootImageWriter.main(), RunBootImage.C
 *
 * <p>The boot record looks like this
 * (note that fields are layed out "backwards"):
 *
 * <pre>
 *                       lo-mem
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |   fieldN-1    |
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |     ...       |
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |    field1     |
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |    field0     |
 *                  +---------------+ \
 *                  |  tib pointer  |  |
 *                  +---------------+  | object header
 *                  |  lock word    |  |
 *                  +---------------+ /
 *                       hi-mem
 * </pre>
 *
 * The "spRegister" field of the boot record points to the word immediately
 * preceeding the top of a stack object (ie. it's ready to accept a "push"
 * instruction). The stack object is an array of words that looks like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *                       lo-mem
 *                  +---------------+ \
 *                  |  tib pointer  |  |
 *                  +---------------+  | array
 *                  |  lock word    |  |   object
 *                  +---------------+  |      header
 *                  |    .length    |  |
 *                  +---------------+ /
 *                  |    <empty>    |
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |     ...       |
 *                  +---------------+
 *                  |    <empty>    |
 *                  +---------------+
 *    spRegister ->      hi-mem
 * </pre>
 *
 * <P> The "ipRegister" field of the boot record points to the first word
 * of an array of machine instructions comprising
 * the virtual machine's startoff code -- see "VM.boot()".
 *
 * <P> The "tocRegister" field of the boot record points to an array of words
 * containing the static fields and method addresses of the virtual
 * machine image -- see "VM_Statics.slots[]".
 *
 * <P> The remaining fields of the boot record serve as a function linkage area
 * between services residing in the host operating system and services
 * residing in the virtual machine.
