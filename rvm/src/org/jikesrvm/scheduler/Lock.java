/**
 Lock provides RVM support for monitors and Java level
 synchronization.

 <p>
 This class may be decomposed into four sections:
 <OL>
 <LI> support for synchronization methods of java.lang.Object,
 <LI> heavy weight locking mechanism,
 <LI> management of heavy weight locks, and
 <LI> debugging and performance tuning support.
 </OL>
 </p>

 <p><STRONG>Requirement 1:</STRONG>
 It must be possible to lock an object when allocations are not
 allowed.
 </p>

 <p><STRONG>Requirement 2:</STRONG>
 After a lock has been obtained, the code of this class must return
 without allowing a thread switch.  (The {@link
org.jikesrvm.ArchitectureSpecific.BaselineExceptionDeliverer#unwindStackFrame(org.jikesrvm.compilers.common.CompiledMethod, org.jikesrvm.ArchitectureSpecific.Registers)
 exception handler}
 of the baseline compiler assumes that until lock() returns the lock
 has not been obtained.)
 </p>

 <p><STRONG>Section 1:</STRONG>
 support for {@link java.lang.Object#notify}, {@link
java.lang.Object#notifyAll}, and {@link java.lang.Object#wait()}.
 When these methods are called, the indicated object must be locked
 by the current thread.  <p>

 <p><STRONG>Section 2:</STRONG>
 has two sections.  <EM>Section 2a:</EM> locks (and unlocking)
 objects with heavy-weight locks associated with them.  <EM>Section
 2b:</EM> associates (and disassociates) heavy-weight locks with
 objects.
 </p>

 <p><STRONG>Section 3:</STRONG>
 Allocates (and frees) heavy weight locks consistent with Requirement
 1.
 </p>

 <p><STRONG>Section 4:</STRONG>
 debugging and performance tuning stuff.
 </p>

 <p>
 The following performance tuning issues have not yet been addressed
 adaquately:
 <OL>
 <LI> <EM>What to do if the attempt to lock an object fails?</EM>  There
 are three choices: try again (busy-wait), yield and then try again,
 inflate the lock and yield to the heavy-weight lock's entering
 queue.  Currently, yield n times, then inflate.
 (This seemed to be best for the portBOB benchmark on a 12-way AIX
 SMP in the Fall of '99.)
 <LI> <EM>When should a heavy-weight lock be deflated?</EM>  Currently,
 deflation happens when the lock is unlocked with nothing on either
 of its queues.  Probably better, would be to periodically (what
 period?) examine heavy-weight locks and deflate any that havn't
 been held for a while (how long?).
 <LI> <EM>How many heavy-weight locks are needed? and how should they be
 managed?</EM>  Currently, each processor maintains a pool of free
 locks.  When a lock is inflated by a processor it is taken from
 this pool and when a lock is deflated by a processor it gets added
 to the processors pool.  Since inflation can happen on one processor
 and deflation on another, this can create an imbalance.  It might
 be worth investigating a scheme for balancing these local pools.
 <LI> <EM>Is there any advantage to using the {@link SpinLock#tryLock}
 method?</EM>
 </OL>
 Once these questions, and the issue of using MCS locking in {@link SpinLock},
 have been investigated, then a larger performance issue
 comes into view.  A number of different light-weight locking schemes have
 been proposed over the years (see last several OOPSLA's).  It should be
 possible to implement each of them in RVM and compare their performance.
