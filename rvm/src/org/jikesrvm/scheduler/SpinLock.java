/**
 *
 * <p> Alternative (to Java monitors) light-weight synchronization
 * mechanism to implement Java monitors {@link Lock}.  These locks
 * should not be used where Java monitors would suffice, or where
 * an adaptive mutex is required.  They are
 * intended to be held only briefly!
 *
 * <p> Normally, contending <code>RVMThread</code>s will spin on
 * this processor lock's <code>latestContender</code> field.  If
 * <code>MCS_Locking</code> is set, the processors spin on processor
 * local data.  This is loosely based on an idea in Mellor-Crummey and
 * Scott's paper in ASPLOS-IV (1991).
 * 1.  Possible project: determine those conditions under which MCS
 * locking performs better than spinning on a global address.
 *
 * <p> Acquiring or releasing a lock involves atomically reading and
 * setting the lock's <code>latestContender</code> field.  If this
 * field is null, the lock is unowned.  Otherwise, the field points to
 * the virtual processor that owns the lock, or, if MCS locking is
 * being used, to the last vp on a circular queue of virtual
 * processors spinning until they get the lock, or, if MCS locking is
 * being used and the circular spin queue is being updated, to
 * <code>IN_FLUX</code>.
 *
 * <p> Contention is best handled by doing something else.  To support
 * this, <code>tryLock</code> obtains the lock (and returns true) if
 * the lock is unowned (and there is no spurious microcontention).
 * Otherwise, it returns false.
 *
 * <p> Only when "doing something else" is not an attractive option
 * (locking global thread queues, unlocking a thick lock with threads
 * waiting, avoiding starvation on a thread that has issued several
 * tryLocks, etc.) should lock() be called.  Here, any remaining
 * contention is handled by spinning on a local flag.
 *
 * <p> To add itself to the circular waiting queue, a processor must
 * succeed in setting the latestContender field to IN_FLUX.  A backoff
 * strategy is used to reduce contention for this field.  This
 * strategy has both a pseudo-random (to prevent two or more virtual
 * processors from backing off in lock step) and an exponential
 * component (to deal with really high contention).
 *
 * <p> Releasing a lock entails either atomically setting the
 * latestContender field to null (if this processor is the
 * latestContender), or releasing the first virtual processor on the
 * circular spin queue.  In the latter case, the latestContender field
 * must be set to IN_FLUX.  To give unlock() priority over lock(), the
 * backoff strategy is not used for unlocking: if a vp fails to set
 * set the field to IN_FLUX, it tries again immediately.
 *
 * <p> Usage: system locks should only be used when synchronized
 * methods cannot.  Do not do anything, (such as trigger a type cast,
 * allocate an object, or call any method of a class that does not
 * implement Uninterruptible) that might allow a thread switch or
 * trigger a garbage collection between lock and unlock.
