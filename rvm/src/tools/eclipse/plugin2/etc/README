README for the Jikes RVM Eclipse Plug-in

======================================================================

To understand this plugin, you need to understand that when you're
using Eclipse as a Java IDE, Eclipse uses two Java Virtual Machines
(JVMs): one to run Eclipse itself, and another that Eclipse uses to
run your user programs under Eclipse.

This plugin lets you use the Jikes RVM as your subsidiary VM for
running your user programs UNDER Eclipse.  The plugin will only work
in an Eclipse session using Jikes RVM to run Eclipse.  The easiest way
to do this is to start Eclipse with the command "rvmeclipse", as
discussed in the Jikes RVM user's manual.  (Look in the manual's index
under "Eclipse".)

In short, the plugin is irrelevant to running Eclipse itself under
Jikes RVM.  It only affects how Eclipse runs inferior Java processes.
So, if you're not using Eclipse as an IDE for Java programming, then
the plugin is irrelevant to your needs.

The Jikes RVM Eclipse Plugin was written in June of 2002 by Jeffrey Palm.
