======================================================================

To understand this plugin, you need to understand that Eclipse uses
two Java Virtual Machines (JVMs): one to run Eclipse itself, and
another that Eclipse uses to run your user programs under Eclipse.

This plugin lets you use the Jikes RVM as your subsidiary VM for
running your user programs.
