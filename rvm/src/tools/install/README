This directory contains stuff that you'll only use if you're
installing Jikes RVM on your system to be invoked as something like
/usr/bin/rvm.  

By default, it installs: the command /usr/bin/rvm, its manual page,
the directories /usr/lib/jikesrvm and /usr/share/jikesrvm, 
and the documentation directory /usr/share/doc/jikesrvm.

Run the command ./debian-install.sh to install in those locations.

You can uninstall by running the command "make uninstall".

Note: /usr/bin/rvm is backwards-compatible with the command in
rvm/bin/rvm; if you have set RVM_ROOT and RVM_BUILD, the installed
"rvm" will try to invoke the one in your Jikes RVM source tree.
