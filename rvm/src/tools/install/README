This directory contains stuff that you'll only use if you're
installing Jikes RVM on your system to be invoked as something like
/usr/local/bin/rvm or /usr/bin/rvm.  

It will install a slightly different version of the "rvm" command that
is backwards-compatible with the one in rvm/bin/rvm; if you have set
RVM_ROOT, the installed "rvm" will try to invoke the one in your Jikes
RVM source tree.
