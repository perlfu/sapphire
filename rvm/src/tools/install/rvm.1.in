./ TODO: We need to use a macro-expansion process like that of 
./ GNU Configure so that we replace this with the proper version.
.TH "RVM" "1" "April 2004" "Jikes RVM version 2.3.2+CVS" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rvm \- execute Java programs on the Jikes RVM Virtual Machine

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B rvm
[OPTION] ClassName [ARGS...]

.B rvm
[OPTION] -jar jarfile [ARGS...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

With the 
.B rvm 
command you can run most Java programs.    
Read the Jikes RVM User's 
Guide to learn how to invoke it; look at the 
.B "SEE ALSO"
section below.


.SH INTERNALS

This version of the 
.B rvm
command is sensitive to whether or not the 
.B RVM_BUILD
and 
.B RVM_ROOT
command are set.  If RVM_BUILD is unset, it defaults to
@RVM_BUILD@.  If RVM_ROOT is unset, it defaults to @RVM_ROOT@.
Then we execute $RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/rvm in place of this program, and
matters proceed as they normally do.


.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

The 
.B Jikes RVM
bug tracking system is at 
.B http://oss.software.ibm.com/jikesrvm/solutions


.SH "SEE ALSO"
