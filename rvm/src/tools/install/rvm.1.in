.SH NAME
rvm \- execute Java programs on the Jikes RVM Virtual Machine
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B rvm
[--installation] [OPTION] ClassName [ARGS...]
.br
.B rvm
[--installation] [OPTION] -jar jarfile [ARGS...]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
With the 
.B rvm 
command you can run most Java programs under the Jikes RVM runtime environment.
The 
.B rvm 
command takes most of the same arguments that the Sun Java
Runtime Environment (JRE)'s 
.B java
command does.  
.
Read the Jikes RVM User's 
Guide (listed below in the 
.B "SEE ALSO"
section)
to learn more about how to invoke it.
.
You can type
.RB \*(lq "rvm -help" \*(rq
to get a list of arguments.   
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
This version of the 
.B rvm
command is sensitive to whether or not the 
.B RVM_BUILD
and 
.B RVM_ROOT
environment variables are set. 
.
This is for backwards compatibility
with the 
.B rvm
command used when one is developing Jikes RVM itself.  
Indeed, this version of the 
.B rvm
command is just a wrapper around the one in the Jikes RVM 
.B RVM_ROOT
directory.
If 
.B RVM_BUILD
is unset, it defaults to
.IR @RVM_BUILD@ .
.
If 
.B RVM_ROOT
is unset, it defaults to 
.IR @RVM_ROOT@ .
(If you want 
.B rvm
to ignore 
.B RVM_BUILD
and
.B RVM_ROOT
then invoke it with the
.B --installation
flag; that will make it always use 
.I @RVM_BUILD@ 
and 
.IR @RVM_ROOT@ .)

Then we execute 
.I $RVM_ROOT/rvm/bin/rvm
with the same arguments that this program was invoked with, and
matters proceed as described in the 
User's Guide.
.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.
The 
Jikes RVM
bug tracking system is at 
.IR http://oss.software.ibm.com/jikesrvm/solutions .
.
.SH "BUGS"
Jikes RVM
does not implement all of the Java API.
.
This is because there is no complete set of free Java class libraries.
Jikes RVM uses the (free) class libraries provided by the GNU
Classpath project.
.
.PP
For this reason, Jikes RVM, (along with every other free Java runtime
systems) cannot pass Sun's full Java Compatibility Tests, and
therefore legally cannot call itself Java.
