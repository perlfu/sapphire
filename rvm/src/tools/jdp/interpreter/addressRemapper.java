/**
 * This class captures the type conversion between address and object reference
 * The RVM stores all statics as integer in the JTOC;  it uses this type 
 * conversion to go between int type and object reference type.
 * The RVM runtime uses VM_Magic to do this type conversion.  This 
 * works since the compiler actually hijacks the call and generates direct 
 * machine code to get around the Java type safety.
 * However, under the JDK, this scheme is not available and the strict type
 * safety does not allow casting from int to object.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is to decouple the integer and object reference
 * into two separate arrays so that we can use the JTOC under the JDK.
 * However, unlike the InterpreterStack which keeps the arrays coindexed, 
 * we cannot use the same index for our two arrays because we need to stay
 * compatible with the RVM scheme for remapping address (when the RVM picks
 * up a JTOC entry that is a reference, it will call addressAsObject() to 
 * do the type conversion).
 * Instead, the object will be inserted into the object array kept in this
 * class in sequential order and the index will be stored in the JTOC entry
 * for this object.  
 * Then the addressAsObject() and objectAsAddress() methods will provide the
 * necessary access interface.
