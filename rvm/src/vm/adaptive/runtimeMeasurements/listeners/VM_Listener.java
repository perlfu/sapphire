/**
 * A VM_Listener object is invoked when online measurement information 
 * needs to be collected.
 *
 * This class does not define the update() method, the call back method from
 * the runtime when a sample should be taken.
 * The expectation is that immediately derived classes define an interface to
 * the update() method from which classes may be further derived.
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS:
 * Classes that are derived from VM_Listener 
 * must inherit directly from Uninterruptible to ensure that they
 * are not interrupted by a thread switch.  
 * Since thread switching is disabled, listeners are 
 * expected to complete execution quickly, and therefore, 
 * must do a minimal amount of work.
