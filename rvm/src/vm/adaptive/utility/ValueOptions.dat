V INITIAL_SAMPLE_SIZE int 20
Initial value of how many samples to take before reporting method hotness to controller


V MIN_SAMPLES int 1
How many samples are needed for a method before we treat it as significant? (i.e., < than this number is treated as noise)

What is the highest optimization level to use when adaptive recompilation is employed?


V DEFAULT_OPT_LEVEL int 2
The optimization level to use for recompilation (with simple strategy)


V FILTER_OPT_LEVEL int 2
At what optimization level should we begin to NOT return to methods to the controller


E PRIMARY_STRATEGY byte PS_ADAPTIVE
Selection of primary controller strategy
"PS_BASE_ONLY baselineOnly baseonly" \
"PS_QUICK_ONLY quickOnly quickonly" \
"PS_OPT_ONLY optOnly optonly" \
