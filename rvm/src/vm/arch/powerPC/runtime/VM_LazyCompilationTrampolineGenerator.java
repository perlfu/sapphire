 * Generate a "trampoline" that jumps to the shared lazy compilation stub.

 * target instructions to imply logical (source) equality of target methods.
 * This is used to perform guarded inlining using the "method test."
 * Without per-method lazy compilation trampolines, ptr equality of target
 * instructions does not imply source equality, since both targets may in fact
 * be the globally shared lazy compilation stub.
