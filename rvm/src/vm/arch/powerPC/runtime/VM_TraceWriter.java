/**
 * A VM_TraceWriter thread offloads interruptible work when in uninterruptible code.
 * Because a trace record is procuced when Jikes RVM is in the midst of a 
 * thread switch, the operations that can be perform are limited.
 * More complicated operations, such as IO, must be off loaded to the VM_TraceWriter.
 * In particular, VM_TraceWriter opens and closes the trace file, and notifies the 
 * producer of events that occur in the applications execution.
 * <p>
 * There is one VM_TraceWriter (consumer) associated with every 
 * VM_HardwarePerformanceMonitor (producer) object.
 * We use processorAffinity to bind a VM_TraceWriter thread to the VM_Processor associated 
 * with the VM_HardwarePerformanceMonitor that VM_TraceWriter is associated with.
 * <p>
 * VM_TraceWriter provides entry points for VM_Callbacks events.
 * Care must be taken to prevent race conditions as the thread that handles
 * the call back will not be VM_TraceWriter and might be partially through
 * handling the event when a thread switch occurs.
 * We maintain the constraint that only the VM_TraceWriter writes the buffers
 * to disk and closes the trace file.
 * <p>
 * The Startup callback, called from MainThread.run(), opens the trace file.
 * The Exit callback, called from VM.sysExit, wakes up VM_TraceWriter to 
 * flush buffers and close the trace file.
 * For any other call back (AppStart, AppComplete, AppRunStart, and AppRunComplete)
 * if a trace file is open, VM_TraceWriter notifies its producer of the call back
 * by calling a method defined by the producer.
 * The coordination between the producer and this consumer is fragile, because
 * we don't use synchronization to minimize overhead.  
 * <p>
 * This class has behavior that is similar as an organizer in the adaptive optimization system.
