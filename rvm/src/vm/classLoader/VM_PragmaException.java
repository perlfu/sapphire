   * because it isn't there yet at boot-image-writing time, when these pragma
   * tests can expect to be heavily used. So, every extending class should have
   * a <CODE>private static final VM_Class</CODE> field that it initializes by
   * passing its class literal to this method. The contents of that field can
   * then be passed by that class's {@link #declaredBy(VM_Method) declaredBy}
   * method to the general {@link #declaredBy(VM_Class,VM_Method) declaredBy}
   * method above.
   * <P>
   * The extra static field winds up being redundant as the <CODE>rvmrt</CODE>
   * version of {@link java.lang.Class Class} already has an equivalent field,
   * but there won't be enough of these pragma classes for that waste to be
   * significant. In using a <CODE>static final</CODE> field, though, there is
   * an <STRONG>assumption</STRONG> that a {@link VM_Class} object found to
   * correspond to a class at image-writing time will be at run time a valid
   * {@link VM_Class} object and still the right one corresponding to that
   * class.
   * <P>
   * Can't just use {@link VM_Class#forName(java.lang.String) VM_Class.forName}
   * because it tries to load, resolve, instantiate, and initialize the class,
   * and instantiation can involve compiling, which can bring us back here to
   * (oops) check for pragmas. So all we try to get here is the VM_Class
   * object in its earliest state. We only need the reference to compare to
   * entries in an exceptions array, anyway. This then unavoidably duplicates
   * a smidge of code from
   * {@link VM_Class#forName(java.lang.String) VM_Class.forName}. But that
   * original code incorrectly assumes class names are restricted to ASCII.
   * Corrected here. (That doesn't mean arbitrary class names will work yet
   * in JikesRVM, only that <EM>this</EM> code won't have to be fixed to
   * support them.)
   * <P>
   * Oddly, using a class literal in the extending class doesn't lead to the
   * same regress, even though class literals are implemented as initializing
   * {@link java.lang.Class#forName(java.lang.String) forName} calls. I suspect
   * that is because they are resolved in the host VM (which doesn't care
   * about our pragmas) at image-writing time, and do not need to be resolved
   * again at rvm startup as long as the classes are in the bootimage.
