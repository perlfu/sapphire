/**
 * This class is used during the processing of reference maps for a method.
 *
 * When a JSR has been processed the processing of a RET is pending. 
 * Need to track which JSR was processed, and where the "return address" value
 * is being held (ie is it on the operand stack, or in a local variable). 
 * The value starts on the top of the stack, but is usually quickly moved to 
 * a local variable.
