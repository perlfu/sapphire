# BURS rules common to all platforms defining common nonterminals
#
# The format of PRODUCTION is 'non-terminal:	rule'
PRODUCTION
# COST is a Java expression that evaluates to an integer.
# The following conventions are more or less followed:
#   Each instruction generated has a base cost of 10
#   A basic (r,r) or (r,riv) costs 3 more
#   A (m,riv) costs 7
#   A (r,m) costs 5
#   Better basic opcodes (inc instead of add 1) decrease cost by 2
COST
