Current status of the JNI implementation

Last updated:  12/9/2002

o These JNI library calls are packaged in the library $RVM_BUILD/libjni.a
  They can be called directly from C by linking to this library(use the options  
  "-L$(RVM_BUILD) -ljni" when compiling):

	JNI_CreateJavaVM
	JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs
	JNI_GetDefaultJavaVMInitArgs
	DestroyJavaVM       
	AttachCurrentThread 
	DetachCurrentThread 
	GetEnv


Not implemented yet:
--------------------

o These JNI functions are not implemented yet.  Calling them
  will cause the VM to dump the VM state and exit.

	DefineClass         
	RegisterNatives     
	UnregisterNatives   


o These new JNI library functions were added in Java 2 and are
  not implemented yet. 

	DeleteWeakGlobalRef         	227          
	EnsureLocalCapacity             26   
	ExceptionCheck                  228      
	FromReflectedField              8      
	FromReflectedMethod             7      
	GetStringCritical               224      
	GetStringRegion                 220      
	GetStringUTFRegion              221      
	NewLocalRef                     25      
	NewWeakGlobalRef                226      
	PopLocalFrame                   20      
	PushLocalFrame                  19      
	ReleaseStringCritical           225      
	ToReflectedField                12      
	ToReflectedMethod               9      



To do items (aka known bugs):
-----------------------------

o Mangled name for native method: we haven't implemented the complete
  rule for converting a native method name in Java to the C procedure
  name yet.  The symptom is an UnsatisfiedLinkError even when the 
  library is loaded correctly with the expected C procedure.

o Enforce the type rule in the reflection code for invoking private method,
  i.e. a subclass cannot invoke the private method of its superclass.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Tips:
-----

o To get a message each time a JNI function is invoked, 
  set the traceJNI flag in VM_JNIFunctions.java

o The unit tests for JNI functions are in the directory src/examples//jni.  
  To run them, go to the directory regression/tests/jni and type 'make'.
