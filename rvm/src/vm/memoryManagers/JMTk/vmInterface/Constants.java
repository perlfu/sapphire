 *  static final int LOG_BITS_IN_INT = LOG_BITS_IN_BYTE + LOG_BYTES_IN_INT;

 *
 * In this case, we simply extend VM_SizeConstants, which has already
 * defined all such constants.  This is in fact a necessity becuase of
 * the wierdness of VM_Processor *extending* Plan (and therefore
 * implementing both Constants and VM_SizeConstants, and thus being
 * exposed to potential duplication of constants).
