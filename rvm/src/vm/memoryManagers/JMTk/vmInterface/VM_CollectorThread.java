/**
 * System thread used to preform garbage collections.
 *
 * These threads are created by VM.boot() at runtime startup.  One is
 * created for each VM_Processor that will (potentially) participate
 * in garbage collection.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Its "run" method does the following:
 *    1. wait for a collection request
 *    2. synchronize with other collector threads (stop mutation)
 *    3. reclaim space
 *    4. synchronize with other collector threads (resume mutation)
 *    5. goto 1
 * </pre>
 *
 * Between collections, the collector threads reside on the
 * VM_Scheduler collectorQueue.  A collection in initiated by a call
 * to the static collect() method, which calls VM_Handshake
 * requestAndAwaitCompletion() to dequeue the collector threads and
 * schedule them for execution.  The collection commences when all
 * scheduled collector threads arrive at the first "rendezvous" in the
 * run methods run loop.
 *
 * An instance of VM_Handshake contains state information for the
 * "current" collection.  When a collection is finished, a new
 * VM_Handshake is allocated for the next garbage collection.
