/**
 * Class that manages work buffers of references to objects that need to
 * be scanned during a collection.  Each GC thread (a VM_CollectorThread)
 * keeps a thread local "getBuffer" of references that it will process.
 * References it finds for objects that need to be scanned, such as
 * objects it marks during the scan phase, it inserts into its thread
 * local "putBuffer".  When a putBuffer becomes full, it is added to the
 * shared queue of buffers to be processed.  When a threads getBuffer is
 * empty, it first attempts to swap it with its own putBuffer, if it has
 * entries.  If it is also empty, it attempts to get a buffer from the
 * shared queue.
 * <p>
 * All GC threads waiting for getBuffers from the shared queue identifies
 * the end of a scan phase during collection.
 * <p>
 * The default size of each buffer is specified by <b>WORK_BUFFER_SIZE</b>,
 * which can be overridden by the command line argument -wbnnn
