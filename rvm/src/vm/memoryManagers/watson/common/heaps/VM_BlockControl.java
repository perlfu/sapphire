/**
 * Used by noncopying memory managers: There is 1 VM_BlockControl
 * for each GC_BLOCKSIZE (see VM_GCConstants.java in this directory)
 * bytes (aka one "chunk"
 * in the small object heap. The array of VM_BlockControls is 
 * allocated by VM_Allocator.boot() at RVM startup. baseAddr
 * is the address of the first byte of the chunk controlled by this
 * object.  It never changes, but is stored to avoid computing it 
 * repeatedly. slotsize is the size of each slot into which this 
 * chunk is partitioned during execution (see VM_SizeControl.java and
 * VM_GCConstants.java.) mark is used to record whether the associated
 * slot is live or not during GC. nextblock is used to chain together 
 * chunks allocated to the same slotsize.  live is set during GC to 
 * indicate that the chunk contains live object(s).  alloc_size is 
 * used to avoid computation during execution.
