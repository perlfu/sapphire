 * Interface for exception delivery called by VM_Runtime.deliverException() to
 * pass control to a stackframe whose method has an appropriate "catch" block 
 * or to step over a stackframe that does not have an appropriate catch block.
 * <p>
 * The exception delivery implementation is specific to the compiler
 * that generated the method's machine instructions.
 * <p>
 * Note that the "deliverException" and "unwindStackFrame" methods of this 
 * class will be called in an environment that does not permit garbage 
 * collection: see VM.disableGC().
 * We must do this because some of the parameters to these methods are raw 
 * machine addresses. They are not recognized by the garbage collector as 
 * Object references and so would not be correctly fixed up in the event of 
 * object motion during gc. As a 
 * consequence, implementors of these methods must not cause object allocations
 * to take place (ie. by calling "new" either directly or indirectly).
