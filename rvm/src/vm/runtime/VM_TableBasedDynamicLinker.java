/**
 * Dynamic linking via indirection tables. <p>
 *
 * The main idea for dynamic linking is that we maintain
 * arrays of field and method offsets indexed by fid and mid.  
 * The generated code at a dynamically linked site will 
 * load the appropriate value from the field/method offset table and 
 * check to see if the value is valid. If it is, then no dynamic linking 
 * is required.  If the value is invalid, then resolveDynamicLink
 * is invoked to perfrom dynamic class loading.  During the
 * process of class loading, the required value will be stored in the 
 * appropriate offset table.
 * Thus when resolveYYY method returns, execution can be restarted 
 * by reloading/indexing the offset table. <p>
 *
 * <p> NOTE: We believe that only use of invokespecial that could possibly 
 * require dynamic linking is that of invoking an object initializer.
 * As part of creating the uninitialized instance of an object, the 
 * runtime system must have invoked the class loader to load the class 
 * and therefore by the time the call to the init code is executed, 
 * the method offset table will contain a valid value.
