/**
 * This thread executes in a distinct daemon thread: its
 * functions are as follows:
 * 
 * <p> its normal state is waiting for a (to be defined) signal
 * 
 * <p> if all RVM threads are "stuck" in C (unlikely but
 * not impossible) it is available to field the timeslicer
 * interrupt.
 *
 * <p> On timeslice end, timer interrupt handler checks each
 * RVM processor to see if it is "stuck in C", i.e., 
 * has not yielded within VM_STUCK_TICKS timeslices.
 * 
 * <p> if t.i.h. is executing on the daemon processor it raises
 * the SIGCONT signal; else the executing thread sends that 
 * signal to the daemon processor.
 *
 * <p> on receiving the SIGCONT signal, the run method loops 
 * through the RVM processors;  it should have been 
 * signalled only if at least one RVM processor is 
 * stuck in C
 * <pre>
 * if it is stuck in C 
 *   mark the associated vp "stuck in C"
 *   if there is an available pthread/(red) vp on the available queue 
 *     choose it;
 *   else get a new pthread; build a new red vp
 *   mark the red vp "stuck in C"
 *   associate the new pthread with the previous vp
 *     the stuck Java thread becomes current on the new rvp
 *     an appropriate idle thread becomes current on the
 *     previous vp - which thread will yield to its idle
 *     queue, triggering schedule in the new pthread. 
 * </pre>
