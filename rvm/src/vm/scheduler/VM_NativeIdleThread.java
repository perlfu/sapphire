 * This thread is scheduled when there is no native work left on a 
 * native virtual processor.  Since we do not wish the underlying pthread
 * to interfere with the execution and scheduling of the other pthreads
 * we put the underlying pthread to wait with an AIX sigwait SVC.
 * <p>
 * When a thread blocked in native code is moved from a RVM Processor
 * to the native processor of this NativeIdleThread, it displaces the
 * NativeIdleThread as the activethread.  The RVM Processor becomes
 * the "returnAffinity" processor of the blocked thread.  The NativeIdleThread
 * is set to be the activeThread of that RVM processor, although
 * its processor register will still point back to the native processor.
 * The pthread_id's of the native and RVM processors are also swapped.
 * After exchanging the active threads & pthread_id's, the NativeIdleThread,
 * in sigWait is signaled. When it returns from sigwait, it resets it processor
 * register, and then yields itself back to its associated native processor,
 * leaving behind its osThread, to takeover execution of other Java threads
 * on that processor.
 * <p>
 * As part of this new "yield" the vp status of the native processor (previously
 * BLOCKED_IN_NATIVE is set to (unblocked) IN_NATIVE.  This will allow the 
 * "stuck in native" thread to attempt a return to Java.
 * <p>
 * When the blocked native thread attempts to reenter java, and finds itself
 * on a native processor, it yields itself back to its returnAffinity
 * processor, leaving behind its osThread.  The osThread, now executing in the
 * native processor, schedules the NativeIdleThread. After returning from yield
 * the NativeIdleThread places its native processor on the "available native
 * processor" queue (previously the DEAD_VP_QUEUE), and then reenters sigWait,
 * waiting for the cycle to start again. (now with a different osThread).
