/**
 * To implement timed waits, a thread may need to be (logically) 
 * on two queues: a waiting queue and a (the) wakeup queue.  To
 * facilitate this, a proxy represents the thread on such queues.
 * Unlike a thread, which can be on at most one queue, a proxy 
 * can be on both a waiting queue and a wakeup queue.
 *
 * Potential race condition: a thread must not be simultaneously
 * removed from both queues and scheduled twice.  lock prevents this.
 *
 * Initial implementation by Susan Flynn Hummel.  Revised to support
 * interrupt() by Bowen Alpern
