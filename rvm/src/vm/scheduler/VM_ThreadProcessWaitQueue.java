/**
 * A wait queue for threads that are waiting for a process
 * to exit.  Used to implement the <code>exitValue()</code>
 * and <code>waitFor()</code> methods of <code>java.lang.Process</code>.
 *
 * <p> The correct operation of this queue relies on the
 * fact that at most one thread in the system will wait
 * for a particular process to exit.  The reason for
 * this restriction is that Unix semantics only allow us to
 * perform a <code>waitpid()</code> once
 * for a given process id.  {@link VM_Process} uses Java synchronization
 * to enforce this property.
 *
 * <p> Note that a strange issue arises on Linux: it is only possible
 * to wait for a child process to exit from the pthread that forked
 * the process.  (This due to the threading model used by Linux, where
 * pthreads have some characteristics of processes.)
 * Because of this limitation, in order for a Java thread to wait for
 * a process to exit, it must migrate to the <code>VM_Processor</code>
 * that created the process.  A <code>VM_ProcessorLock</code>
 * in the virtual processor object protects access to this queue, since it
 * may be accessed from another <code>VM_Processor</code>.
 * When polling for exited processes, we have to be careful to ignore
 * <code>VM_Thread</code>s that are still being dispatched on another
 * virtual processor.
 *
 * <p> I would imagine that AIX pthreads work correctly with respect to
 * allowing arbitrary pthreads to perform a <code>waitpid()</code>.
