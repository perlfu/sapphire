We are keeping the stand alone xalan test in addition
to the DaCapo xalan because the standalone test we
run here tests a JVM feature in which the application
defines a java Class from a stream of bytes without
providing the class name (forces JVM to parse
bytestream to extract the class name).  This is a useful
regression test for a fringe feature of classloading
and until we have some other more focused unit test for
just this behavior we can't drop this test in favor of
DaCapo xalan.
