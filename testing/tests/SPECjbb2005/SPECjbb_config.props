# SPECjbb properties file
#
# This is a SAMPLE file which you can use to specify characteristics of
# a particular system under test, and to control benchmark
# operation. You can reuse this file repeatedly, and have a version for
# each system setup you use. You should edit the reporting fields
# appropriately. All of this can still be edited in the output properties
# file after you run the test, but putting the values in here can save
# you some typing for attributes which do not change from test to test.
