You may not sell iburg or any product derived from it in which iburg is
a significant part of the value of the product. You may use the output

IBM Addendum.

We have modified Iburg in two ways:
 (1) We modified the input patterns it accepts to be consistent with
our intermediate representation.
 (2) We modified it to produce Java code instead of C code.

All bug reports related to the use of jburg in building RVM
should be reported to the Jikes RVM group at IBM and _not_ to David
R. Hanson.  Please report them using the the normal RVM bug
reporting channels.
