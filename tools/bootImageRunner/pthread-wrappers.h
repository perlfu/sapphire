 * It is unfortunate that stdio.h on the GNU libc defines various
 * pthread types, such as pthread_t and pthread_mutex_t.  It means that we
 * can not define our own silly versions of those types below; that would be
 * the natural thing to do, but we can't.  
 * So, FIRST we include <pthread.h>, to define all of the types that the
 * function prototypes need, THEN we define macro versions of all of the
 * functions that we use. 
 *
 * Including <pthread.h> means that if we ignorantly fail to override some
 * pthread function or other, we may not immediately get a failure to compile.
 *
 * We won't even necessarily fail to link with -lpthread, because the GNU C
 * library includes its own versions of some of those stubs.  Ugly.
