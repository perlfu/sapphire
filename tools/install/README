This directory contains stuff that you can use to install
Jikes RVM on your system to be invoked as a real command named "rvm"
(invokable by any user as, for example, "rvm HelloWorld").  

By default, it installs: the "rvm" command /usr/bin/rvm, its manual
page, the directories /usr/lib/jikesrvm and /usr/share/jikesrvm, and
the documentation directory /usr/share/doc/jikesrvm.

Run the command ./debian-install.sh to install in those locations.
Edit macro-expand.sh to change the installation locations.

You can uninstall by running the command "make uninstall".

Note: /usr/bin/rvm is backwards-compatible with the command in
rvm/bin/rvm; if you have set RVM_ROOT and RVM_BUILD, the installed
"rvm" will try to invoke the one in your Jikes RVM source tree.
