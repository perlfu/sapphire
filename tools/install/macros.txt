We must define these macros to turn the .in files into real ones.
These are the values we'll use for an installation on a
Debian system:


@DOC_DIR@

Always  /usr/share/doc/jikesrvm


@USER_MANUAL@

/usr/share/doc/jikesrvm

Where the user's manual is on the local machine.



@BIN_DIR@

/usr/bin


@RVM_ROOT@
/usr/share/jikesrvm

@RVM_BUILD@
/usr/lib/jikesrvm
