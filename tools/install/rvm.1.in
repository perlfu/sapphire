.SH NAME
rvm \- run Java programs with Jikes RVM
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B rvm
[--installation] [OPTION...] ClassName [ARGS...]
.br
.B rvm
[--installation] [OPTION...] -jar jarfile [ARGS...]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Jikes RVM is a free runtime environment and virtual machine for Java.  
.
With the 
.B rvm 
command you can run most Java programs under the Jikes RVM runtime environment.
The 
.B rvm 
command takes most of the same arguments that the Sun Java
Runtime Environment (JRE)'s 
.B java
command does.  
.
Read the Jikes RVM User's 
Guide (listed below in the 
.B "SEE ALSO"
section)
to learn more about how to invoke it.
.
You can type
.RB \*(lq "rvm -help" \*(rq
to get a list of arguments.   
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
This version of the 
.B rvm
command is sensitive to whether or not the 
.B RVM_BUILD
and 
.B RVM_ROOT
environment variables are set. 
.
This is for backwards compatibility
with the 
.B rvm
command normally provided in Jikes RVM's development kit
and used when one is developing Jikes RVM itself.  
Indeed, this version of the 
.B rvm
command is just a wrapper around the one in Jikes RVM's
.B RVM_ROOT
directory
(as \fBRVM_ROOT\fR\fI/bin/rvm\fR).
If 
.B RVM_BUILD
is unset, it defaults to
.IR @RVM_BUILD@ .
.
If 
.B RVM_ROOT
is unset, it defaults to 
.IR @RVM_ROOT@ .
(If you want 
.B rvm
to ignore 
.B RVM_BUILD
and
.B RVM_ROOT
then invoke it with the
.B --installation
flag; that will make it always use the installed Jikes RVM, by always
resetting 
.B RVM_BUILD
and 
.B RVM_ROOT to 
.I @RVM_BUILD@ 
and 
.IR @RVM_ROOT@ .)

Then we execute 
.I $RVM_ROOT/bin/rvm
with the same arguments that this program was invoked with, and
matters proceed as described in the 
User's Guide.
.
.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.
The 
Jikes RVM
bug tracking system is at 
.IR http://oss.software.ibm.com/jikesrvm/solutions .
.
.
.SH "BUGS"
Jikes RVM
does not implement all of the Java API.
.
This is because there is no set of free Java class libraries that
implements the entire Java API;
Jikes RVM uses the (incomplete) class libraries provided by the GNU
Classpath project.  
.
.PP
For this reason, Jikes RVM, (along with every other free Java runtime
systems) cannot pass Sun's full Java Compatibility Tests, and
therefore legally cannot call itself Java.  However, the subset of 
the Java class libraries that Jikes RVM implements does seem to be
adequate for running most popular Java applications, including
.BR Ant 
and
.BR Eclipse .
