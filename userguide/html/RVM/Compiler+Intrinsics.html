                    <p>A compiler intrinsic will usually generate a specific code sequence. The code sequence will usually be inlined and optimized as part of compilation phase of the optimizing compiler.</p>

<h2 id="CompilerIntrinsics-Magic">Magic</h2>

<p>All the methods in <code>Magic</code> are compiler intrinsics. Because these methods access raw memory or other machine state, perform unsafe casts, or are operating system calls, they cannot be implemented in Java code.</p>

<p>A Jikesâ„¢ RVM implementor must be <em>extremely careful</em> when writing code that uses <code>Magic</code> to circumvent the Java type system.  The use of <code>Magic.objectAsAddress</code> to perform various forms of pointer arithmetic is especially hazardous, since it can result in pointers being &quot;lost&quot; during garbage collection.  All such uses of magic must either occur in uninterruptible methods or be guarded by calls to <code>VM.disableGC</code> and <code>VM.enableGC</code>. The optimizing compiler performs aggressive inlining and code motion, so not explicitly marking such dangerous regions in one of these two manners will lead to disaster.</p>

<p>Since magic is inexpressible in the Java programming language , it is unsurprising that the bodies of <code>Magic</code> methods are undefined. Instead, for each of these methods, the Java instructions to generate the code is stored in <code>GenerateMagic</code> and <code>GenerateMachineSpecificMagic</code> (to generate HIR) and <code>BaselineCompilerImpl</code> (to generate assembly code) (Note: The optimizing compiler always uses the set of instructions that generate HIR; the instructions that generate assembly code are only invoked by the baseline compiler.). Whenever the compiler encounters a call to one of these magic methods, it inlines appropriate code for the magic method into the caller method.</p>
